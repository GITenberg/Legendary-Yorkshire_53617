famous and redoubtable hero of
history and romance, Arthur, King
of the British, who so valiantly defended his
country against the pagan Anglo-Saxon invaders
of the island? Who has not heard of the lovely
but frail Guenevera, his Queen, and the galaxy of
female beauty that constituted her Court at
Caerleon? Who has not heard of his companions-in-arms&mdash;the
brave and chivalrous Knights of
the Round Table, who went forth as knights-errant
to succour the weaker sex, deliver the
oppressed, liberate those who had fallen into the
clutches of enchanters, giants, or malicious
dwarfs, and especially in quest of the Holy
Graal, that mystic chalice, in which were caught
the last drops of blood of the expiring Saviour,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
and which, in consequence, became possessed of
wondrous properties and marvellous virtue of a
miraculous character?</p>

<p>If such there be, let him lose no time in
perusing Sir John Mallory's "La Morte d'Arthur,"
the "Chronicles of Geoffrey of Monmouth,"
the "Mabinogian of the Welsh," or the
more recent "Idylls of the King," of Tennyson.
According to Nennius, after vanquishing the
Saxons in many battles, he crossed the sea, and
carried his victorious arms into Scotland, Ireland,
and Gaul, in which latter country he obtained a
decisive victory over a Roman army. Moreover,
that during his absence Mordred, his
nephew, had seduced his queen and usurped his
government, and that in a battle with the
usurper, in 542, at Camlan, in Cornwall, he was
mortally wounded; was conveyed to Avalon
(Glastonbury), where he died of his wound, and
was buried there. It is also stated that in the
reign of Henry II. his reputed tomb was opened,
when his bones and his magical sword
"Excaliber" were found. This is given on the
authority of Giraldus Cambrensis, who informs us
that he was present on the occasion. But the
popular belief in the West of England was that he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
did not die as represented, his soul having
entered the body of a raven, which it will inhabit
until he reappears to deliver England in some
great extremity of peril.</p>

<p>This is what is told us by old chroniclers of
Western England, the Welsh bards, and some
romance writers; but in Yorkshire we have a
different version of the story. It is true, say our
legends, that Arthur was a mighty warrior, the
greatest and most valiant that the island of
Britain has produced either before or since; a
man, moreover, of the most devout chivalry and
gentle courtesy, and withal so pure in his life and
sincere in his piety as a Christian, that he alone
is worthy to find the Holy Graal, if not in his
former life, in that which is forthcoming&mdash;for he
is not dead, but reposes in a spell-bound sleep,
along with his knights, Sir Launcelot, Sir
Gawaine, Sir Perceval, etc., and that the time is
coming when the needs of England will be such
as only his victorious arm, wielding his magically
wrought Excaliber, can rescue from irretrievable
ruin. He sleeps&mdash;it is asserted&mdash;along with his
knights, in a now undiscoverable cavern beneath
the Castle of Richmond, whence he will issue in
the fulness of time, scatter the enemies of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
England like chaff before the wind, as he so
frequently dispersed the hordes of Teuton
pagans, and place England on a higher eminence
among the nations of the earth than it has ever
previously attained. This enchanted cave has
been seen but once, and by one man only.
It happened in this wise:&mdash;</p>

<p>Once on a time there dwelt in Richmond one
Peter Thompson. At what period he flourished
is not recorded, but it matters not, although a
little trouble in searching the parish registers and
lists of burgesses of the town might reveal the
fact. He gained a living by the fabrication of
earthenware, and hence was popularly known
amongst his comrades and townspeople as Potter
Thompson. He was a simple and meek-minded
man, small in stature and slender in limb, never
troubling himself with either general or local
politics. His voice was never heard at the noisy
meetings of the vestry, nor did he join in the
squabbles attendant on the meetings of the
electors for the choice of their municipal
governors or representatives in Parliament; he
merely recorded his vote for the candidate who
came forward as the representative of the colour
he supported, leaving the shouting and quarreling<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
and cudgel-playing to those of his fellow-townsmen
who had a liking for such rough work.
As for himself, he was only too glad when he
had discharged his duty as a citizen to get back
to his clay and his wheel, for he was an
industrious little fellow, had plenty of work, and
was thus enabled, by living a frugal life, to lay
by a little money, and would have lived a
comfortable and happy life but for one circumstance.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, Peter Thompson was a married
man; not that matrimony, in the abstract, is a
misfortune, but he was unfortunate inasmuch as
his wife was a termagant, and made his life
miserable. Her tongue went clack, clack,
clacking all day long; nothing that he did was
right. She declared herself to be the greatest
fool in Richmond to have united herself to an
insignificant little wretch like him; and even
when the bed curtains were drawn around them
at night, the poor fellow was kept awake for an
hour or more while she dinned into his ears a
lecture on his manifold faults and his failures of
duty as a husband. Peter seldom replied, but
bore it all with meekness, and allowed her to go
on with her monologue until she was tired, or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
ceased for want of breath. At times, when she
was more exasperating than usual, he would start
up from his wheel, clap his hat on his head, and
rush out of the house to escape her pertinacious
scolding. At such times he would go wandering
about the hills and picturesque scenery by which
Richmond is environed, and especially about the
hill on which stands the Castle, and amongst the
castle ruins, remaining away for three or four
hours, moodily meditating on the mischance or
infatuation which had led him to ally himself
with so untoward a helpmate.</p>

<p>It chanced one day that Peter, unable to
endure the persecution of his wife's tongue,
rushed out of his house with the full intention of
throwing himself into the Swale, so as to end his
misery there and then. It was a brilliant
summer's day, and there was a glorious sheen
cast over hill and vale, rock and ravine, the
silvery river winding between its emerald-hued
banks and the clumps of foliaged woodland&mdash;over
the Castle keep standing pre-eminently
above all other buildings, church tower, ruined
friary, antique bridge, and the quaint houses of
the burghers, with the tower of Easby gleaming
in the distance, imparting to the whole scene,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
which is one of the most picturesque in Yorkshire&mdash;which
is saying a great deal, and which for
natural beauty can scarcely be surpassed in
England&mdash;a charm which had a wonderful effect
on Peter's perturbed mind. He was a lover of
nature in all her aspects, and an ardent admirer
of the landscape beauties which surrounded his
native town; and he began to reflect, as he ran
down the slope, that if he carried out his purpose,
he would never more be able to delight his eyes
with the lovely prospects of nature so lavishly
displayed before him at that moment; and by
the time he reached the river's bank he had
almost determined to live on and find compensation
for his domestic discomforts in his
communings with nature&mdash;or at least, continued
he to himself&mdash;"I will take another turn among
the hills and rocks and old ivy-mantled ruins,
before I bid good-bye to it all." He wandered
along round the base of the Castle hill, his spirits
becoming more elevated the farther he went, as
he gazed on the glorious landscape which
gradually became revealed to his view. Anon he
fell into a contemplative mood, and reasoned
calmly and philosophically on the wisdom of
disregarding the minor ills of life, when it was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
possible for him as a compensating alternative to
revel in the delights he was now enjoying, and he
soon forgot altogether his purpose of terminating
his woes and his life together from the parapet of
Swale bridge. Onward he wandered; when
suddenly turning a corner he came upon a spot
altogether unknown to him&mdash;a ravine which
seemed to wind away under the Castle hill, walled
in with rugged rocks, from whose crevices sprang
upward trees and shrubs, whilst underfoot was a
flooring of rough scattered stones and fragments
of fallen rocks, which appeared not to have been
trodden for centuries. Astonished at the sight,
for he imagined that he knew every nook in the
neighbourhood, he rubbed his eyes to ascertain
whether he was dreaming; but he found himself
to be fully awake, and the unknown ravine to be
a palpable reality. It just flashed across his
mind that sorcery had been at work, and that
what he beheld was the result of necromancy, for
in his time enchanters, warlocks, wizards, and
witches were rife in the land; but Peter had a
bold heart, and he resolved upon solving the
mystery by an exploration of the recesses of the
ravine, let what would come of it.</p>

<p>Summoning up all his courage, Peter entered the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
ravine, stumbling now and then over the stones
bestrewn along his pathway. The road wound
about, now to one side then to another, and the
trees overhead to stretch out towards each other
so as to overshadow the ravine and impart a
twilight effect, which, as Peter proceeded onward,
deepened into gloom, and eventually almost to
darkness. At this period, when he was compelled
to move along with caution, he
encountered what at first seemed to be a wall of
rock forming the end of the ravine. On feeling
it carefully he found it to be a huge boulder
which obstructed his path, but, his courage failing
him not, he found means to clamber over it
and land safely on the further side. On looking
about him, as well as he could by the dim light,
he found that he had alighted on the entrance to
a cavern, the boulder seeming as if it had been
placed there to prevent the intrusion of unauthorised
persons, and then he imagined that it
might be the cave of a gang of banditti, and was
at once their treasure house and their refuge in
times of peril; and this idea seemed to be confirmed
by the circumstance that he could
perceive, in the extreme distance, a glimmer of
light. He felt that it would be extremely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
dangerous to be discovered in the purlieus of
their haunt, but curiosity got the better of his
fears, and he resolved upon going forward,
mentally adding "After all it may be nothing
more than the daylight streaming in at the other
end, and by going on I may come out into the
open air without having to return by the rough,
shinbreaking road by which I have come;" and
onward he went, feeling his way by the rocky
walls cautiously and slowly, and, it must be added,
with some degree of trepidation.</p>

<p>As he proceeded along, the distant light increased,
and could be seen beaming through an
opening like a doorway, with a mild effulgence
resembling moonlight. Clearly it could not be
the light of the sun streaming in through the
aperture, and Peter, becoming more convinced
that he was either approaching a robbers' haunt
or a scene of enchantment, crept along as silently
as possible, with some timidity, it is true; but
having come thus far, and his curiosity being excited
to the utmost pitch, he determined to carry
out his adventure to the end. As he approached
the portal, he stood to listen; but not the
slightest sound broke the death-like stillness, and
concluding from this that the cave was not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
occupied&mdash;at least, was not at present&mdash;he
ventured onward with silent footstep, and stood
within the illuminated aperture. What was his
amazement cannot be told at beholding the scene
before him. The opening gave entrance to a
lofty and spacious cavern, its walls glittering with
crystals and spars, whilst from the roof depended
a profusion of stalactites, glistening and scintillating
with hues of spectroscopic brilliancy. The
light which was diffused around seemed to be
something supernatural; it was not that of the
sun, nor that of the moon, nor was it our modern
electric light; but seemed to be an intensity of
phosphoric radiance&mdash;soft, mild, and provocative of
slumber&mdash;which came not from any lamp or
other visible source, but appeared to be self-evolved
from the atmosphere. In the centre of
the cave, upon a rocky table or couch, lay the
figure of a kingly personage, resting his head on
his right hand, after the fashion of the recumbent
effigies in our mediæval churches. He was clad
in resplendent armour and a superb over-cloak,
with a golden crown, studded with precious
stones, encircling his head. By his side was a
circular shield emblazoned with arms, which
would have told Peter, had he been versed in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
heraldry, that the owner was the famous King
Arthur; whilst close by, suspended from the wall,
were a diamond-hilted sword in a chased golden
scabbard, and a highly ornamented horn, such as
were used by military leaders for collecting their
scattered troops. Around the King lay his
twelve Knights of the Round Table, some
prostrate on the floor, others reposing on fragments
and projections of the rocks, each one
handsome in figure and reclining in unstudied
natural grace, presenting a study for a painter.
They all lay as still as death save that their
heaving chests and audible breathing showed
that they were wrapped in profound slumber.
Peter gazed upon them for a while with
wondering eyes, keeping within the doorway, so
as to have the road clear behind him for escape,
in case of any hostile demonstration on the part
of the knights. As they still slumbered on,
without any sign of awakening, he plucked up
courage enough to go amongst them; and,
attracted by the splendour of the sword, he took it
down to examine it more closely; then took it by
the handle, and half drew it from its sheath. The
moment he had done so, the sleepers around him
gave symptoms of awakening, turned themselves,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
and seemed to be preparing to rise; but the spell
of disenchantment was not complete. Peter,
terribly alarmed at what he saw, pushed back the
sword into the scabbard, threw it on the floor,
and hurried with all speed to the doorway;
whilst the half-awakened slumberers sank back
again into deep sleep. Peter, not noticing this,
rushed through the opening, thinking the knights
were following him to inflict some terrible punishment
on him&mdash;perhaps that of death&mdash;for his
presumptuous intrusion. It was but a few
moments, and he reached the boulder which defended
the entrance, and which was much more
difficult to scale from that side. He was
endeavouring to find projections to enable him
to clamber up, when he heard a hollow sepulchral
voice exclaim from the cave:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Potter, Potter Thompson,<br /></span>
<span class="i3">If thou had'st either drawn<br /></span>
<span class="i3">The sword or blown the horn,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thoud'st been the luckiest man<br /></span>
<span class="i3">That ever yet was born."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>With teeth chattering, hair on end, and a cold
perspiration suffusing his forehead, he made a
desperate effort, scrambled somehow or other
over the stone, and running with fleet footstep,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
regardless of the rough roadway, gained the open
air without any other damage than a few bruises
and a terrible fright. He went home, and had
to encounter a fearful scolding for remaining out
so long and neglecting his work. He told his
wife the tale of his adventures, but she only
laughed it to scorn, saying, "You old fool! and
so you have fallen asleep on the hillside and
want to persuade me that your dream was a
reality. It's a pretty thing that you should leave
your wheel and go mooning about in this way,
leaving your faithful wife to suffer the effects of
your idleness."</p>

<p>Many a time since then did Peter seek for the
ravine but could never find it; but it is confidently
assumed that Arthur and his knights are
still slumbering under the Castle hill.</p>

</div><p><span class="dropletter">T</span><span class="smcap">hrough</span> the valley of Wensleydale,
in the North Riding of Yorkshire,
flows the river Yore or Ure, passing
onward to Boroughbridge, below which town it
receives an insignificant affluent&mdash;the Ouse&mdash;when
it assumes that name, under which
appellation it washes the walls of York, and
proceeds hence to unite with the Trent in forming
the estuary of the Humber; but although
it loses its name of Yore before reaching York,
the capital city of the county is indebted to it for
the name it bears. The river in passing through
Wensleydale reflects on its surface some of the
most romantic and charming landscape scenery of
Yorkshire, and that is saying a great deal, for no
other county can equal it in the variety,
loveliness, and wild grandeur of its natural
features.</p>

<p>"In this district, Wensleydale, otherwise
Yorevale or Yorevalle," says Barker, "a variety<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
of scenery exists, unsurpassed in beauty by any
in England. Mountains clothed at their summits
with purple heather, interspersed with huge
crags, and at their bases with luxuriant herbage,
bound the view on either hand. Down the
valley's centre flows the winding Yore, one of the
most serpentine rivers our island boasts&mdash;now
boiling and foaming, in a narrow channel, over
sheets of limestone&mdash;now forming cascades only
equalled by the cataracts of the Nile&mdash;and anon
spreading out into a broad, smooth stream, as
calm and placid as a lowland lake. On the banks
lie rich pastures, occasionally relieved, at the
eastern extremity of the valley, by cornfields.
There are several smaller dales branching out of
Wensleydale&mdash;of which they may, indeed, be
accounted part. Of these the principal are
Bishopdale and Raydale, or Roedale&mdash;the valley
of the Roe&mdash;which last contains Lake Semerwater,
a sheet of water covering a hundred and
five acres, and about forty-five feet deep.
Besides this lake, the natural objects of interest
in the district best known are Aysgarth Force,
Hardraw-scaur, Mill Gill, and Leyburn Shall&mdash;the
last a lofty natural terrace from which the
eye may range from the Cleveland Hills at the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
mouth of the Tees to those bordering upon
Westmoreland."</p>

<p>The valley is exceedingly rich in historic
memories and noble monuments of the architectural
past&mdash;"castles and halls inseparably
united with English story, and abbeys whose
names, whilst our national records shall be
written, must for ever remain on the scroll; with
fortresses which have been the palaces and
prisons of kings. Of these, Bolton Castle, the
home of the Scropes, and one of the prisons of
Mary, Queen of Scots, and Middleham Castle,
where dwelt the great Nevill, the king-maker,
and the frequent and favourite residence of the
Duke of Gloucester, afterwards King Richard
III., and the venerable remains of Yorevale, or
Jervaux, and of Coverham Abbeys, are alone
sufficient to immortalise a district of country."</p>

<p>In former times the dale was covered by a
dense forest, the home of countless herds of deer,
wild boars, wolves, and other wild animals.
There were no roads, but glades and trackways,
intricate and winding, very difficult and puzzling
to traverse, so that travellers often became
benighted, without being able to find other
shelter than that afforded by trees and bushes.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
At the village of Bainbridge there is still
preserved the "forest horn," which was blown
every night at ten o'clock from Holyrood to
Shrovetide, to guide wanderers who had lost
their way to shelter and safety from the
prowling beasts of prey. A bell also was rung
at Chantry, and a gun fired at Camhouse with
the same object. In the first century of the
Christian era there existed in the valley of
Roedale a large and for that time splendid city,
inhabited by the Brigantian Celts. It nestled in
a deep hollow, surrounded by picturesque hills and
uplands, and was environed by the majestic trees
of the forest, where the Druids performed the
mystical rites and ceremonials of their religion.
The houses were built of mud and wattles, and
thatched with straw or reeds, and the city was a
mere assemblage of such private residences,
without any of the public buildings, such as
churches, chapels, town houses, assembly rooms,
baths, or literary institutions, such as now-a-days
appertain to every small market town; yet it
was spoken of as a "magnificent city," and such
it perhaps might be as compared with other and
smaller towns and villages.</p>

<p>It was about the time when Flavius Vespasian<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
annexed Britain to the Roman Empire, and
the Brigantes had been partially subdued by
Octavius Scapula, the Roman Governor of
Britain, but before York had become Eboracum&mdash;the
Altera Roma of Britain&mdash;and the influence
of the conquerors of the world had not
penetrated to this remote and secluded spot in
the forest of Wensleydale, so that the people of
the city still retained their old religion, customs,
and habits of life; still stained their bodies with
woad, clothed themselves with the skins of
animals, and still fabricated their weapons and
implements of bronze. Joseph of Arimathea had
planted the cross on Glastonbury Hill, but the
people of this city had never even heard of the
new religion that had sprung up in Judea, and
went on sacrificing human beings to their
bloodthirsty god, cutting the sacred mistletoe
from the oaks of their forest, and drawing the
beaver from the water, emblematic of the
salvation of Noah and his family at the deluge,
of which they had a dim tradition.</p>

<p>The angels of heaven took great interest in
the efforts of the apostles who, in obedience to
their Master's command, went forth from Judea
to preach the gospel of glad tidings and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
doctrine of the cross to all mankind, and had
especially noted the erection of the Christian
standard on Glastonbury Hill, in the barbarous
and benighted island of the Atlantic. One of the
heavenly host, indeed, became so much interested
in the conversion of the natives of this isle&mdash;which
he foresaw would, in the distant centuries,
become a great centre of evangelical truth, and, by
means of missionaries, the foremost promulgator
of religious light to other benighted peoples of
the earth&mdash;that he determined to descend thither,
and, under the guise of a human form, go about
amongst the people, and in some measure prepare
them for the reception of the teachings of
the companions of St. Joseph.</p>

<p>Midwinter had come, the period when the sun
seemed to the Britons to be farthest away from
the earth, and when, according to the experience
of the past, he would commence his return with
his vivifying rays; and the Druids were holding
joyous ceremonial in celebration of this annually
recurring event. The sun was viewed as a
superhuman beneficent being who journeyed
across the heavens daily to dispense heat and life,
and to cause the fruits and flowers and cereals to
bloom and fructify, and give forth food for men<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
and animals, who in summer approached near to
the earth, and in winter retired to a distance
from it&mdash;for what end or purpose they knew not.
Nevertheless they deemed it wise to propitiate
him by two great ceremonials of worship&mdash;the one
at midsummer, attended by blazing "Baal-fires"
on the hills (a custom which still survives in some
parts of Yorkshire, where, on Midsummer-eve,
"beal-fires" are lighted), a festival of rejoicing
and thanksgiving for the ripening crops and
fruits; the other at midwinter, which partook
more of the character of a supplicating worship,
imploring him, now that he was far distant, not
to withdraw himself entirely from the earth,
but return as he had been wont to do, and again
cheer the world with his beams of brightness and
warmth. On the occasion of this particular
festival, the weather was stormy and cold; the
pools were frozen over, and the ground covered
with snow, whilst a chilling sleet, driven by a
biting north-eastern wind, beat upon those who
were exposed to its influence in the open air.
The festival was proceeding in a cleared space of
the forest circled round by lofty trees, which was
the open-air natural temple of the Druids; its
walls built by the hand of their god, and its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
dome-like roof the floor of the habitation where
he dwelt. Whilst the Druids were engaged in
offering up prayers, the bards in singing anthems
of praise, and the vates investigating the entrails
of slain animals, to read therein forecasts of the
future and the will of the gods, especially of the
Sun God, in whose honour the festival was held,
the venerable figure of an aged man might be
seen descending the hill and approaching the
city. He seemed to be bowed down with the
infirmities of age, and to breast with difficulty
the forcible rushing of the wind. His white
flowing beard, which reached almost to his waist,
was glittering with incrustations of ice; and his
legs trembled as he came along, leaning on his
staff, with feeble and uncertain footsteps. He
was clad in a long gabardine, which he wrapped
tightly round him, to protect his frame as much
as possible from the inclemency of the weather;
his head was covered by a hat with broad
flapping brim; and his feet were sandalled, to
shield them from the roughness of the road.</p>

<p>He came amongst the cottages and passed
from door to door, asking for shelter and food,
but everywhere was repulsed, and at times with
contumely and opprobrious epithets. No one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
would take him in beneath their roof; no one
had charity enough to give him a crust or a cup
of metheglin, and onward he went until he came
to the spot where the festival was progressing
under the direction of the Arch-Druid, a man of
extreme age, but of commanding stature and
majestic port.</p>

<p>The appearance of the angel (for he it was, in
the guise of infirm and poverty-stricken
humanity) caused some sensation, chiefly in
consequence of his peculiar and outlandish dress,
and all eyes were directed upon him as he walked
boldly and unhesitatingly, but with halting step,
to the centre of the circle where the hierarchs
were grouped.</p>

<p>The angel, addressing himself to the Arch-Druid,
inquired, "Whom is it that you worship
in this fashion?"</p>

<p>"Who are you," replied the Druid, "that you
know not that our midwinter festival is in honour
of the great and gloriously shining God, who
reveals himself to us in his daily march across the
sky?"</p>

<p>"Then you worship the creature instead of the
creator?"</p>

<p>"How the creature? He whom we worship<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
was never created, but has existed from all
eternity."</p>

<p>"Alas! blind mortals, you labour under a
Satanic delusion. Know that what you, in your
ignorance, worship is but an atom in the great
and resplendent universe of worlds and suns,
called into existence by the fiat of Him
whom I serve, who alone is self-existent,
immortal, and the Creator of all men and all
things."</p>

<p>"You speak in parables, stranger, and in an
impious strain. Mean you to say that the god-sun
is not great and powerful, he who causes the
herbage to grow and the trees to give forth fruit?
Can he do this if he be not a god?"</p>

<p>"He is merely the instrument of the one
Almighty God, whose Son, on the anniversary of
this day, became incarnate on earth, and died on
the cross in a land far distant from this, that man
might not be subjected to the penalty for disobedience
to His laws, thus dying in his stead, to
satisfy the ends of justice."</p>

<p>"And you say that he, a mere man, who died
in the distant land you speak of, was the son of
one who created the sun?"</p>

<p>"Most certainly."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span></p>

<p>"Then I must say that you speak rank blasphemy."</p>

<p>And the priests and other officials re-echoed
the shout, "Blasphemy! blasphemy!" and the
people around took it up, and the cry of
"Blasphemy!" rose up from a thousand tongues.</p>

<p>"Slay him! stone him!" was then cried by
the excited people, and they began to take up
stones and hurl them at the old man, who,
shaking the snow of the city from his sandals,
and saying "Woe be unto you," passed through
the surrounding crowd, and disappeared amongst
the forest trees.</p>

<p>The dusky shades of evening, or rather
afternoon, were drawing in as the angel passed
through the wood; and as, in his incarnate form,
he was subject to all the sufferings and
discomforts humanity is liable to, he feared that
he would have to pass the night, with all its inclemency
of weather, with no other shelter than
that afforded by a tree trunk or the branches of a
bramble bush, but after wandering some time he
came upon a cleared space, where he found some
sheep huddling together on the lee side of a
rising ground, and judging that where sheep
were men would not be far distant, he passed up<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
the hillside and gladly hailed a gleam of light
issuing from a cottage window. He approached
and knocked at the door, which was opened by a
comely, middle-aged dame, whilst, by the fire of
peat, sat a man whom he presumed to be her
husband, occupied in eating his evening meal,
with a shepherd dog by his side, eagerly looking
out for the bones and chance pieces of meat
which his master might think proper to throw
him.</p>

<p>"Good dame," said he to the woman, "have
you charity enough to give me shelter from the
storm, a crust of bread to allay the cravings of
hunger, and permission to imbibe warmth from
your fire into my aged and frozen limbs?"</p>

<p>"Yes, that indeed we have, venerable father,"
replied she. "Come in and seat you by the fire,
and we will see what the cottage can supply in
the way of victuals."</p>

<p>He stepped in, and was welcomed with equal
kindness by the husband, who placed for him a
seat near the fire, took off his coat, which he
suspended before the fire to dry, and gave him a
sheepskin to throw over his shoulders; whilst
the dame bustled about in the way of cooking
some slices of mutton and bringing out some of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
her best bread, with a wooden drinking vessel
filled with home-made barley liquor, not unlike
the ale of after days.</p>

<p>He was then invited to seat himself at the
table, a board resting on two trestles, and ate
heartily of the viands before him. After the
meal, and when he was thoroughly warmed and
made comfortable, he entered into conversation
with the worthy couple, and ascertained that the
man was a shepherd, and made a fairly comfortable
living out of his small flock of sheep, which
supplied him and his wife with raiment and flesh
meat for food, besides a small surplus for barter
to procure other necessaries. He told them that
he was a wanderer on the face of the earth, not a
Briton, but allied to people who lived in the far
east near the sun rising, and that he had come
hither to tell the Britons of the true God, and
that they whom they worshipped were not gods
at all; to all which they listened with wonderment
and awe, but displayed none of the bigotry
and hostility to adverse faiths which had been so
practically shown in the city. With eloquent
tongue he explained to them the mysteries of the
Christian religion, but they comprehended him
not, such matters being entirely beyond the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
capacities of their understandings. Nevertheless
they were much interested in some of the
narratives, such as the nativity and the visit of
the Magi; the miraculous cures of the sick; the
crucifixion, the resurrection, and the ascension,
all which were told with great graphic power,
and listened to with rapt ears; and they sat on
late into the night in this converse, and then a
bed of several layers of straw was made for the
stranger in a warm corner of the cottage, and a
couple of sheep skins given him for coverlets.</p>

<p>The following morning broke bright and cheerful,
a complete contrast to the preceding day.
The sun came out with a radiance as brilliant as
it was possible for a midwinter sun to do, and
lighted up the hills, on which the snow crystals
glistened, and the roofs of the houses in the
valley below, with a splendour seldom beheld at
that period of the year, and the people of the
city hailed the sight as a response to their
festival prayers, that the God of Day would still
continue to shower his blessings upon them, and
bring forth their crops and fruits in due course.
The guest at the shepherd's cottage, wearied with
his wanderings and the buffeting of the storm,
slept long after the sun had risen; but his hosts<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
had been up betimes, the shepherd having gone to
look after his sheep, and his wife to prepare a
warm breakfast for him on his return. When
this was ready, and the shepherd had come home,
their guest was awakened, and partook with
them of their meal of sheep's flesh, brown bread,
and ewe's milk. He had performed certain
devotions on rising, such as his entertainers
understood not, but which they assumed to be
acts of adoration and thanksgiving to his God.</p>

<p>Resuming his cloak, now thoroughly dried, his
flapped hat, and his long walking staff, he went
out to pursue his journey. With his hosts he
stood on the elevated ground on which the
cottage was situated, and looked down upon the
city in the valley below, from which there rose
up the busy hum of voices of men going about
their vocations for the day, with them the first
of their new-born year.</p>

<p>The stranger looked down upon the city for
some moments in silence; then stretching forth
his arms towards it, he exclaimed, "Oh city!
thou art fair to look upon, but thou art the
habitation of hard, unfeeling, and uncharitable
men, who regard themselves alone, and neither
respect age nor sympathise with poverty and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
infirmity! Thou art the abode of those
who worship false gods, and shut their ears
to, nay, more, maltreat those who would
point out their errors and lead them into
the path of truth; therefore, oh city! it is
fitting that thou shouldst cease to cumber the
earth; that thou shouldst be swept away as were
Sodom and Gomorrah. As for you," he added,
turning to the shepherd and his wife, "you took
the stranger in under your roof, sheltered him
from the storm, fed him when ahungered, and
comforted him as far as your means permitted.
For this accept my thanks and benison, and
know that my benison is worth the acceptance,
for I am not what I seem&mdash;a frail mortal&mdash;but
one of those who stand round the throne of the
God I told you of last evening, which is in the
midst of the stars of the firmament. May your
flocks increase, and your crops never fail; may
you live to advanced age, and see your children
and children's children grow up around you,
wealthy in this world's wealth, honoured, and
respected." Turning again towards the city, and
again stretching forth his arms over it, the
mysterious stranger cried out in a voice that
might be heard in the streets below:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span></p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Semerwater, rise; Semerwater, sink;<br /></span>
<span class="i3">And swallow all the town, save this lile<br /></span>
<span class="i3">House, where they gave me meat and drink."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Immediately a loud noise was heard, as of the
bursting up of a hundred fountains from the
earth, and the water rushed upward from every
part of the city like the vomiting of volcanoes;
the inhabitants cried out with terror-fraught
shouts, and attempted to escape up the hills,
but were swept back by the surging flood,
which waved and dashed like the waves of the
tempestuous sea. Higher and higher rose the
water; overwhelmed the houses and advanced up
the sides of the hill, engulfing everything and
destroying every vestige of life, and eventually it
settled down into the vast lake as it may now be
seen.</p>

<p>It may be thought that this was a cruel act of
revenge on the part of the angel, but we have
the authority of Milton, that the angelic mind
was susceptible of the human weakness of
ambition; why, therefore, should it not be
actuated by that other human passion of
revenge?</p>

<p>The shepherd and his wife gazed on the
spectacle of the destruction of the city with awe-stricken<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
countenances, when another spectacle
filled them with equal amazement. They turned
their eyes upon their guest, who still stood by
them, but who was undergoing a wonderful
transformation. From an aged and infirm man
he was becoming youthful in appearance, of noble
figure, with lineaments of celestial beauty, and an
aureola of golden light flashing round his head.
His tattered and way-worn garments seemed to
be melting into thin air and passing away, and in
their place appeared a long white robe, as if
woven of the snow crystals of the surrounding
hills; whilst from his shoulders there streamed
forth a pair of pinions, which he now expanded,
and waving an adieu to his late entertainers, he
rose up into the air, and in a few minutes had
passed beyond their sight.</p>

<p>The shepherd's flocks soon began to multiply
wonderfully, and he speedily became one of the
richest men of the countryside. His sons grew
up and prospered as their father had, and their
descendants flourished for many generations in
their several branches as some of the most
important and wealthy families of the district.
The old man and his wife abandoned the old
Druidical religion, and prayed to the unknown<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
God of whom their guest spoke on the
memorable evening preceding the destruction of
the city; and when the Apostles of Christianity
came hither, were among the first converts.
There may be sceptics who may doubt the truth
of this legend, but there the Lake of Semerwater
still remains, and what can be a more convincing
proof of its truth, as old Willet was wont to say,
when pointing to the block of wood at the door
of his inn at Chigwell, as a triumphant proof of
the truth of the story he had been narrating.
The rustics of the neighbourhood also assert that
they have seen, fathoms deep in the lake, the
chimneys and church spires of the engulfed city;
but as there were neither churches nor chimneys
when that city was in existence, we are inclined
to believe that this is an optical delusion.</p>

have been witnessed in the picturesque
valley of Ryedale, northward of
Malton, and not far distant from the spot where,
in after ages, sprung up the towers of Byland
Abbey, one fair midsummer eve in the earlier
half of the sixth century&mdash;a scene that would
have gladdened the heart of a painter, and made

Celtic name we are informed not, but it was a
Celtic village, and inhabited by Celtic people,
who had been Christianised, and taught the

Round Table&mdash;whose members were patterns of
valour and exemplars in religion, and who went
forth as knights-errant to correct abuses, protect
the fairer and weaker sex, chastise oppressors,
release those who were under spells of enchantment,
and do battle with giants, ogres, malicious
dwarfs, and enchanters, also with dragons,
hippogriffs, wyverns, serpents, and other
similarly obnoxious creatures. Who hath not
read of their marvellous adventures and valorous
exploits in the quest of the Sang-real, the
histories of Sir Launcelot and Sir Tristram, La
Morte d'Arthur, and the Idylls of the King?
Witches and warlocks, sorcerers and ogres,
tyrants and oppressors, then abounded in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
land, and beauteous damsels, the victims of their
cruelty and lust, so that there was plenty of
work, to say nothing of the reptiles of the forests,
for the entire army of valiant knights who went
forth from Caerleon on the Usk in quest of
adventures, inspired by the approving smile of
Queen Guinevere and of the fair ladies in whose
honour they placed lance in rest, and whose
supremacy of beauty they vowed to maintain in
many a joust and tournament.</p>

<p>The village lay in a spot where nature had
spread out some of her loveliest features of valley,
upland, and meandering river of silvery sheen
running through the midst; whilst trees of
luxuriant foliage, in groups and thickets of forest
land, enshrined the whole as a fitting framework
for the sylvan picture. Farmsteads were
scattered about, and a cluster of humbler
cottages, the habitations of the serf class of farm
labourers constituted the village.</p>

<p>As we have seen, it was Midsummer Eve, a
day of festival and rejoicing which had been
observed from time immemorial, for now the sun
approached the nearest to the zenith with its
fructifying beams, and in celebration of the event
a huge bonfire had been built up on an eminence<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
outside the village; whilst around it, hand in
hand, danced the youths and maidens with much
glee and merriment, with boisterous mirth, and
many a joke and song, and moreover with no
lack of flirtation between the lads and lasses, who
footed it merrily, and became more and more
vigorous in the dances as the flames mounted
higher and higher. Although they knew it not,
this village carnival was a survival of the
paganism of the past, when the remote ancestors
of the existing generation worshipped Baal, the
great Sun God. It had come down through
centuries of homage to the creature instead of
the Creator, and having been regarded as a great
holiday, did not suffer extinction at the advent of
Christianity, but was permitted to be retained in
that capacity, without any reference to religious
ceremonial, which in course of time was entirely
forgotten. And it is a remarkable instance of
the vitality of ancient customs to observe that in
some parts of Yorkshire, in Holderness to wit,
"Beal fires" are lighted on Midsummer Eve,
even to the present day.</p>

<p>The elders of the village were seated about in
groups on the turf, watching the upblazing of the
fire, casting approving smiles on the joyous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
gambols and incipient match-making of their
progeny, and talking of their own juvenile days,
when they were equally happy partners in the
circling dance. The blue sky overhead was
cloudless, and in the western horizon the setting
sun shot forth beams of golden light; and all
was hilarity and happiness. A queen of the
festival had been chosen&mdash;the most beautiful
maiden of the village, a sweet girl of eighteen,
with brilliant complexion, melting blue eyes, and
flowing curls of flaxen hue. A platform of
boughs had been improvised upon which to carry
her on the shoulders of a half-dozen young
bachelors back to the village with songs of
triumph, and the procession had just been
arranged, when a loud hissing sound was heard
to issue from the neighbouring forest, a sound
which in these days would have been attributed
to a passing railway train; but which then
sounded strange and unearthly, and spread
consternation among the merrymakers, who
turned and looked with panic-stricken countenances
in the direction from whence the sound
came.</p>

<p>The first impulse of the crowd was to fly to
their homes, from the unknown object of dread,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
but curiosity prompted a counter-impulse, a
desire to see what gave rise to the fear-inspiring
sound. Nor had they long to wait, for a few
minutes after a monstrous reptile, with the body
of a serpent and the head of a dragon, its mouth
seeming, to their excited imaginations, to breathe
out flame, issued from the wood and came across
the open space with fearful but graceful undulations
towards the terrified villagers. The air
appeared to become charged, too, with a pestiferous
influence, issuing from the nostrils of the
monster, which increased in intensity the nearer
it came. With shrieks and wild cries, those who
had been dancing so merrily but a few minutes
before took to their heels to find refuge in their
cottages, exclaiming, "Oh, that Sir Peter Loschi
were here to deliver us from the monster!" All
reached their habitations and barred their doors;
all save one, the beautiful young queen of the
festival, the pride of the village&mdash;the beloved of
every one&mdash;who, fascinated like a bird by the eyes
of the reptile, had stood gazing upon it so long
that she was quite in the rear of the fugitives,
and was overtaken by the serpent, who immediately
coiled the foremost part of its body round
her, and in this fashion carried her back into the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
forest. As she did not reappear, it was
concluded that she had been devoured; and day
after day one young damsel after another disappeared
after going to the spring for water, or
on other open-air errands, all of whom, it was
doubted not, had furnished meals for the monster.
Indeed, at times he was seen carrying them off as
he had done the poor little queen, until at
length the village seemed to be becoming
depopulated of its maidenhood. The men at
times went armed with bludgeons to attack the
serpent in his cave on the hill side, but were ever
driven back by the poisonous exhalations of the
animal's breath, which seemed to render them
faint and powerless; and two or three of the
bolder spirits who approached the nearest to the
den died under its influence. And the people
continued to cry, "Oh, Sir Peter Loschi, why do
you tarry?"&mdash;for in him lay all their hope of
deliverance.</p>

<p>This Sir Peter Loschi, whose aid was so
frequently and fervently invoked, was the owner
of a castle and certain broad acres in the vicinity.
He was a Celt of unadulterated blood, although
his name has nothing Celtic about it. Single
names were then only used, with the exception of an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
addition of some personal characteristic or locality,
for distinction sake when there were two persons
bearing the same, and we may suppose that the
two names of Peter and Loschi originally formed
one word, which has become altered and corrupted
in passing from generation to generation, in a
similar manner to that of George Zavier, which
became transmuted through Georgy Zavier, etc.,
to eventually Corky Shaver. Be that as it may,
he was the last male of a long line of ancient
British knights and warriors, and was himself not
inferior to any of his ancestors in military skill
and almost reckless daring, having fought with
distinction against the wild hordes of Picts and
Scots, who came down from their desolate northern
mountains to make raids on the more fertile
lands of the Britons south of the Border, and
against the piratical Saxons and Angles who
were endeavouring to get a foothold on the
island. He was one of King Arthur's Knights
of the Round Table, and was often at the Court
of Queen Guinevere at Caerleon, consorting
with his brother knights in the mutual recital of
their adventures, in friendly tilting matches, and
in dallying with the fair ladies of the Court, one
of whom he had chosen as the mistress of his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
heart, and whose favour he wore in front of his
helmet at many a passage of arms in the courtyard
of a castle or in the field of a tournament.
Occasionally he went forth for periods of six or
twelve months as a knight-errant, for the purpose
of redressing wrongs, slaying enchanters, etc.,
and was known as the Knight of the Sable
Plume, from that ornamental appendage of his
casque. The cognisance that he bore on his
shield was a chevron arg. between three plumes
sable, on ground or; and many a doughty deed
had he performed, young as he still was, under
this cognisance.</p>

<p>He did not spend much time at his ancestral
home in Ryedale, being so much occupied at
Court and in the quest of adventures as a knight-errant,
only going there occasionally to regulate
matters relating to his household and estates,
look after his vassals and retainers, and make
arrangements for the well-being of the villagers.
He had now been absent about three years,
having, at the instance of his ladye-love at
Caerleon, donned his armour, taken his lance in
hand, and gone for that space of time to protect
the impotent, redress the injured and oppressed,
and slay giants and sorcerers, as a test of his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
valour, at the end of which said period, if he had
acquitted himself as a preux-chevalier, she might
possibly consent to become the mistress of
Ryedale Castle. The period was now drawing
to a close, and he had performed many a valorous
deed; he had slain a gigantic Saxon in single
combat; he had recovered the standard of King
Arthur from some half-dozen Picts, who had
seized it after killing the bearer of it; he had
rescued a damsel from the hands of an enchanter;
another from the fangs and claws of a lion, and a
third from a giant who was dragging her along
by the hair of her head; he had killed
a dragon, a griffin, and a hippogriff, had done
many another wondrous and valorous deed,
and was now going back to Caerleon to claim the
hand of the lady at whose behest he had performed
all these marvellous achievements, little
dreaming all the time that his own people in
Ryedale were in sore need of his stalwart arm
and trusty sword.</p>

<p>As the knight had been northward, it was
necessary to pass through what is now Yorkshire
on his way to Caerleon, and he deemed it expedient
to call at his Ryedale Castle to see how matters
had been going on there during his long absence.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
It was about a month after the first appearance
of the "worm," when the villagers were
beginning to experience the truth of the saying
that "hope deferred maketh the heart sick,"
having lost many members of their community
through the propensity of the serpent for human
flesh, and no Sir Peter coming to deliver them
from the ravages of the monster, when the figure
of a horseman, with a nodding black plume, was
seen "pricking o'er the plain," who was immediately
recognised as the veritable Sir Peter
Loschi, which gave rise to an exhilarating shout
of welcome from the villagers, who cried, "Now
shall we be delivered from the ravenous worm."
Sir Peter rode on to his castle, where the first
being to welcome him was a favourite mastiff,
who came gambolling about him with the most
affectionate demonstrations of rejoicing at seeing
his master once more. The following morning a
deputation of the villagers waited upon him,
explained their troubles in respect to the worm,
and prayed for his assistance in ridding them of
the monster. He inquired into the particulars,
and having been accustomed in his travels to
several encounters with noxious animals of this
character, he readily understood what he would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
have to deal with, and promised his aid, but
added that as some preparations would be
necessary, the enemy being of an exceptional
description, he would not be able to undertake
it within a month, and that they must endure it
the best they could in the interval.</p>

<p>Sir Peter got a sight of the serpent, and a
formidable monster he appeared to be, more
terrible than any he had previously met with;
and he saw that it behoved him to make special
provision for the combat. He pondered the
matter over for a few days, and then mounted his
steed and rode to Sheffield, where he employed
certain cunning artificers to make him a complete
suit of armour studded with razor blades.
Although razors are alluded to by Homer, and
have been used by the Chinese for unknown
centuries, it is doubtful whether they were a
staple manufacture on the banks of the Sheaf
and the Rivelin in the sixth century. It is true
that Chaucer speaks of a "Sheffield whittle," but
this was eight centuries afterwards, and it is
equally to be doubted whether Sheffield, even as
a village, existed at that time; but anachronisms
are of small moment in legends, and we are
required to accept it as a fact, that the knight<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
had his novel suit of armour fabricated in the
valley of the Sheaf.</p>

<p>When it was completed, he returned with it to
Ryedale, and gladly was he welcomed by the
villagers, as the serpent had been committing
more ravages amongst the population. He had
a sword, a Damascus blade of wonderful
keenness, which possessed certain magical properties,
similar to those of King Arthur's famous
Excaliber; and one morning, after donning his
armour, he took the sword in his hand and went
forth to the combat. His dog accompanied him,
and it was with difficulty that he was prevented
from leaping up in caressing gambols against the
sharp razor blades.</p>

<p>The serpent had its den in the side of a
wooded eminence near East Newton, by Stonegrave,
which has since then gone by the name of
Loschy Hill, in memory of the great fight
between the Knight and the Dragon. Sir Peter,
who was on foot, strode along boldly towards the
hill, followed by his dog, which seemed to be
perfectly aware that some exciting sport was
before them, as he rushed about hither and
thither, sniffing the air, as if his keen scent gave
him intimation that game of an unusual character<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
was not far off, and he barked and growled, as if
in defiance of the foe; whilst the villagers stood
afar off, with eager countenances, to watch the
progress of the combat. As the knight came
nearer, he became aware of a pestiferous odour
that seemed to contaminate the air; and the dog
scented and sniffed, and gave vent to more
prolonged growlings and louder barking, and
seemed to tremble with excitement in anticipation
of the coming fray.</p>

<p>The serpent had not yet breakfasted, and
seeing the man and dog approach, darted from his
den and made for the dog, with which he thought
to stay his appetite as a first mouthful, but the
dog was too nimble and eluded his attack, leaping
upon one of the curves of its body and biting it
with mad excitement; whilst the knight struck
it a blow with his sword which almost cut off its
head, but the wound healed up instantly, and the
serpent coiled itself round his body, in order to
crush the life out of him, and then devour him at
its leisure. It had not, in doing so, taken into
account the razor blades, which cut its body in a
multitude of gashes, and caused the blood to
stream down on the earth; but this was not of
much consequence, as it immediately uncoiled and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
rolled itself on the earth, when all the wounds
closed up. Foiled in this attack, the monster
then began to vomit out a poisonous vapour, so
horrible and overcoming that the knight seemed
ready to sink under its influence, but rallying his
energies, he aimed a blow which cut the serpent
in two, but the severed parts joined again immediately.
All this time the monster was hissing
in a fearful manner, and breathing out poison,
and the knight began to fear he must succumb
and become its prey; but determined not to give
in so long as he could continue the fight, he
aimed another blow with his sword and severed a
portion of the tail end, although feeling persuaded
that it would become reunited as before; but his
dog, evidently a sagacious animal, having witnessed
the former reunion, seized it in its teeth
and ran off with it to a neighbouring hill, then
returned and carried away other portions as they
were cut off successively. The serpent writhed
with pain, but afraid, or seeing the uselessness of
attacking the razor-armed man, made many
attempts to seize the dog, but in vain, as he was
too agile to be caught; therefore he depended
more on the venom of his breath at this juncture,
which he continued to pour forth, and which he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
knew must eventually overpower his enemy.
The dog had returned from his third or fourth
journey and came up to his master, wagging his
tail in seeming congratulation of the cleverness
with which they were gradually accomplishing
the destruction of the foe, when the serpent made
a spring upon him, but at the same instant the
knight's magic sword descended upon his neck
and severed the head from the body, which the
dog at once seized and carried off to a distance,
placing it on a hill near where Nunnington
Church now stands.</p>

<p>The monster was now dead which had caused
so much terror and desolation, and the villagers
shouted with joy as they saw the head carried
past by the dog. Meanwhile the knight stood by
the remaining portion of the body as it lay prone
on the earth, quivering with the remains of its
vitality. He was exhausted with his exertions,
but more by the poisonous exhalation which the
body still gave forth, but in rapidly diminishing
volume. He was recovering from its effects and
was waiting awhile to gain sufficient energy to
leave the scene of his triumph, when the dog
returned, but apparently in a very languid
condition; still, however, evincing marks of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
satisfaction and pleasure at the conquest he and
his master had achieved. The knight stooped
down to pat caressingly his faithful companion,
who, in return, reached up and licked his face.
Unfortunately, in carrying away the head, the
seat of the venom, the dog had imbibed the
poison, and in licking his master's face had
imparted the virus to him, and a few minutes
were sufficient to produce its fatal effects, the
knight and his dog falling to the earth together,
and when the villagers came up they found both
dead.</p>

<p>Although the villagers were rejoiced at the
death of the serpent, their lamentations were
equally great over the fate of the knight, who
had sacrificed his life for their deliverance; and
for many a month and year did they cherish his
memory and mourn his death.</p>

<p>In Nunnington Church there is a monument of
a knight, a recumbent effigy, with a dog
crouching at his feet; and this, tradition says, is
the tomb of the valorous Sir Peter Loschi and
his equally valorous dog, who were buried
together, and the monument erected in grateful
memory of their achievement.</p>

</div><p><span class="dropletter">O</span><span class="smcap">ne</span> of the most interesting localities
in broad Yorkshire, rich in historic
lore and fruitful in legend, is that
which comprehends within its limits the twin
towns of Aldborough and Boroughbridge, on the
river Ure. Their history extends back to the
Celtic and Roman times, when Aldborough or
Iseur, the Isurium of the Romans, was the
capital of the Brigantian Celts, and near by ran
northward from York a great Roman road, which
crossed the Ure by a ford, which was supplanted
after the Conquest by a wooden bridge, which
gave rise to a great convergence of roads at this
point, and the growth of a town, which obtained
the name of Boroughbridge, <i>i.e.</i>, the borough
by the bridge.</p>

<p>This spot, says Dr. Stukeley, was in the
British time "the scene of the great Panegyre of
the Druids, the midsummer meeting of all the
country round, to celebrate the great quarterly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
sacrifice, accompanied with sports, games, races,
and all kinds of exercises, with universal festivity.
This was like the Olympian and Nemean meetings
and games among the Grecians."</p>

<p>Between the two towns there stands protruding
from the earth three rough-hewn and
weather-worn obelisks of rag-stone or mill-stone
grit, which could not have been brought from a
distance of less than seven miles, and gave rise to
a sense of wonder how such stupendous masses
could have been brought hither and placed
upright in position by the Celts with their utter
lack of mechanical appliances. The northernmost
rises eighteen feet, the southernmost
twenty-two and a half feet, and the centre one
also twenty-two and a half feet above the ground,
and from an excavation made under the latter, it
was found to have an entire length of thirty feet
six inches. The estimated weight of the
northernmost is thirty-six tons, and of the other
two thirty tons each. Originally there were four
stones, which were seen by Leland in Henry
VIII.'s time; but one of them fell or was
removed for the sake of the materials&mdash;useful for
road repairing&mdash;in the seventeenth century.
Camden imagined them to be factitious compositions<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
of sand, lime, and small pebbles
cemented together; but there is no doubt they
were quarried at Plumpton, the rock there
corresponding exactly with their grit. The
Romans made use of them as metæ, the turning
point in their chariot races. There have been
varying and differing conjectures by antiquaries
as to their origin and purpose, but all agree as to
their remote antiquity, dating back certainly
1800 years, the most probable conjecture as to
their purpose being that they were connected in
some way with Druidical worship. They go by
the name of "The Devil's Arrows," and tradition
gives an account of their origin altogether
different from antiquarian conjectures, and much
more in accordance with their popular designation.
Thus runs the legend:&mdash;</p>

<p>It was soon after the Crucifixion that certain
Apostles of the Cross, headed by Joseph of
Arimathea, found their way from Palestine to
the remote and benighted isle of Britain, in
obedience to the Divine command to go forth
and preach the Gospel to every creature. After
their disembarkation they proceeded inland until
they came to Glastonbury; and ascending the
hill there, Joseph struck his walking staff in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
earth and proclaimed that there should be
established the first Christian church of Britain,
and in confirmation thereof his staff miraculously
took root, put forth branches, and although it
was midwinter&mdash;Christmas Day&mdash;budded and
blossomed into a rose, as its successors here
continued to do on every successive Christmas
Day. The Apostles preached to the barbarian
people, made some converts, and erected a
temporary wooden church for the performance of
divine service, which was the precursor of the
magnificent Abbey that afterwards rose on the
site, and flourished in great prosperity until its
extinction under the sacrilegious hand of Henry
the Eighth.</p>

<p>When the new faith had taken root at
Glastonbury, the Apostles divided themselves
into bands of two or three, and departed north,
south, east, and west, to proclaim the glad
tidings in other parts of the island. One of
these bands, going northwards, preached to the
Cornabii and the Coritani of Mid-Britain, and
then passed onward to the Brigantes, the
greatest and most warlike of the kingdoms of
Britain. They travelled on foot, staff in hand,
and subsisted on the charity of the people; but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
had often to endure great hardships, having often
to pass through scantily peopled districts, where
wild fruits were their only food, the water of the
wayside brooks their drink, and their sleeping
couches the heather of the moor or the turf
under the canopy of a forest tree. But all these
discomforts they endured with cheerfulness,
besides perils from wolves, wild boars, and other
denizens of the woodlands, feeling assured that
their Master would reward them a thousand-fold
for their sufferings in His service.</p>

<p>On entering the Brigantian kingdom they
learned that the capital city was Iseur, some considerable
distance northward, and thither they
bent their way in the hope of enlightening the
King in spiritual matters as a means of facilitating
the conversion of his people. With wearied steps
they passed from village to village, through
forests and swamps, and over black moorlands,
fording the rivers where practicable, or where
they were too deep for so doing going along the
bank until they met with a fisherman or villager
to ferry them across in his coracle; and in due
course, after many days of toilsome journeying,
came to the city of Iseur.</p>

<p>The city stood in a forest clearing, surrounded<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
by a stockade of felled trees, with an entrenchment
for protection against enemies, and for the security
of their flocks and herds against the attacks of
wild beasts. In the centre stood the King's
Palace, a tolerably spacious edifice built of
unhewn blocks of stone, placed in cyclopean
fashion without mortar; and scattered around
were the mud-built and straw-thatched dwellings
of the people. There was no temple of their
deity, the gods of the Britons disdaining mortal-built
places of worship. But adjacent was a
separate forest clearing, with a circling of huge
forest oaks, on which grew the sacred mistletoe,
which constituted a temple not built with hands;
and in which was a pool of water, indispensable
in the ceremonials of their religion, where the
beaver abounded, and was used as an emblem of
the flood, of which the Britons had a tradition;
and here were constructed the wickerwork forms
of gigantic human beings, which at certain
seasons were filled with men, women, and
children, and burnt to propitiate the wrath of
their god.</p>

<p>They proceeded to the palace of the King and
asked for an audience, which was granted them
after some demur; the King feeling uncertain,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
from the description his attendants gave of their
foreign aspect, outlandish dresses, and imperfect
utterance of the British language, whether they
might not be enemies, assassins, or sorcerers
come hither to take his life or subject him to
some other evil. He received them seated on a
sort of throne, clad in a white, coarsely woven
tunic of wool reaching half way down his thighs,
and leaving the lower limbs altogether uncovered,
and over his shoulders a wolf-skin mantle,
whilst he supported his dignity by holding in his
right hand a long bronze-headed spear, with a
richly-carved shaft. By his side sat his Queen,
and at his feet gambolled three or four children,
whilst around him stood representatives of the
Druidical hierarchy&mdash;the Druids proper or high
priests, the Eubates or soothsayers, and the
Bards who chanted anthems to the glory of
their god and recited odes in praise of the
warriors and great men of their race.</p>

<p>The King inquired of the strangers who they
were and what was their purpose in thus coming
to his court. The Apostles replied that they
were people of a far distant land, near the
sunrising, and had come hither to show them
their errors in worshipping false gods, and point<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
out to them the true object of worship, the one
only God, the Maker of heaven and earth, and
the awarder of happiness or misery in the future
life beyond the grave. A murmur of dissatisfaction
arose at this announcement amongst the
Druids, who whispered amongst themselves that
it was fitting such blasphemers should be offered
up as sacrifices to their god.</p>

<p>"Truly," said the King, "you have come on a
strange errand; we are firm believers in and
devout worshippers of the one Supreme God, as
you pretend to be. Do we not yearly offer up
on His altars hundreds of human victims to
propitiate His good-will? What more would
you have? We believe what you do, and a great
deal more, for we have a host of minor deities
whom we pay adoration to. Methinks you had
better return to your own country and not
trouble us with your hallucinations, so as to
cause a schism in the faith. We are content
with our own belief, which teaches us that when
we die the souls of those who have done justly
will pass gradually into a higher and higher
sphere, until at length, when perfectly purified, it
will become absorbed in the essence of the Deity,
or become an inferior god; whilst those of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
wicked will be transformed to the bodies of
inferior and unclean animals, and eventually be
annihilated."</p>

<p>The Apostles upon this explained briefly the
principles of the Christian religion, the fall of
man and his loss of the divine favour, his
necessary condemnation to temporal and eternal
death, and the redemptorial scheme, in which
God himself, or rather his Son, who was identical
with himself, suffered death on the cross, taking
upon himself, in lieu of man, the threatened
penalty.</p>

<p>"Is your God dead, then?" inquired the
King; "or is it possible for God to die. If so,
our faith is better than yours, for our God is
immortal."</p>

<p>The Apostles then entered into an elaborate
disquisition on the subtleties of the necessity and
nature of the Divine scheme for the salvation
of the human race, but the reasonings were too
abstruse for the King's comprehension, as, indeed,
were they for the more cultured minds of the
Druids; therefore the King declined any further
discourse on the subject, adding that he was perfectly
willing that they should be courteously
treated and have fair play, as they had come so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
far with the intent, as it seemed to them, of
doing him and his people a service; therefore he
would appoint a day on which they should have
a full and fair discussion with the Druids on the
merits of the respective faiths, and in the meantime
they should be hospitably entertained at his
cost, and with this the audience terminated.</p>

<p>It happened that at this time the Father of
Evil was prowling about Britain, with the object
of thwarting the efforts of St. Joseph and his
band of missionaries for the evangelisation of the
land. He employed himself chiefly about
Glastonbury and its neighbourhood, the primitive
and central seat of British Christianity, and
centuries elapsed before he relaxed his persistent
attempt to eradicate the faith, hostile to himself,
which had taken root there. Nine hundred
years afterwards we find that he was a perpetual
annoyance to the holy St. Dunstan in his
Glastonbury cell, continually intruding upon him
when engaged in his studies, and offering to him
the most seductive temptations, until, on one
occasion, he made his appearance before him
when he was engaged on some blacksmith work,
and commenced tempting him to sell his soul to
him for unbounded wealth and the highest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
temporal distinction. The saint, however, was
proof against his temptations, and resolved to free
himself once for all from his importunities, took
his red-hot tongs from the fire, and seized him by
the nose. The devil roared out lustily with the
pain, although one would fancy, from fire being
his natural element, that it would not incommode
him greatly; nevertheless, he prayed abjectly to
be released from the tongs, but the saint would
not release him until he promised to give him no
further annoyance.</p>

<p>He had followed in the footsteps of the three
Apostles on the northern mission, and was
present, although invisible, at the interview with
the King of the Brigantes; and when the conference
between the Apostles and the Druids was
arranged by the King, he determined upon
presenting himself at the meeting in a more
tangible and palpable form, to overthrow the
arguments of the former by the power of his
eloquence and logical force of reasoning, feeling
exceedingly loth to run the risk of losing so
cherished a section of his dominions, which would
ensue in case the King should be convinced by
the preaching and the powerful arguments of the
Apostles.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span></p>

<p>The conference was appointed to come off on
the slopes of the Hambleton Hills, at the foot of
Roulston Crag and there, on the auspicious
morning, might be seen a large assemblage
gathered together, presenting a very animated
and picturesque grouping. The King, as
president of the assembly, took his seat on an
improvised throne. He was clothed in the most
splendid of his regal vestments, and held in his
hand his bronze-headed spear, as an emblem of
his Royal authority. On his right stood a group
of Druids, clad in long white linen robes, with
circlets of oak leaves round their heads, and on
his left the three Christian Apostles, in their
weather-stained Oriental garments, whilst
scattered around, was a considerable number of
Brigantian warriors, courtiers, agriculturists, and
serfs more or less garmented in coarse woollen
fabrics or skins of animals, or without clothing of
any kind, but with painted or tattooed skins, on
which were depicted figures of the sun, the moon,
and sundry animals. The King opened the proceedings
by stating the object of the meeting,
and calling upon the Apostles to explain what
they wished to inculcate, promising them a
fair and candid hearing, and assuring them that if<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
what they said appeared at all consonant with
reason, it should have due consideration. In all
respects the meeting was very similar to that
which was convened nearly 600 years afterwards
by Eadwine, King of Northumbria, for a
discussion of the merits of Christianity, between
St. Paulinus, the apostle of Rome, and Coiffi, the
High Priest of Woden, which resulted in the
second establishment of Christianity in the
district, which constitutes the modern Yorkshire.
Just as one of the Apostles was commencing to
speak, a venerable Druid, with a beard reaching
half-way down to his waist, and attired in the
official long white robe, entered the assembly, and
made his obeisance to the King, who inquired
who he was and whither he had come. "I am
the High Priest, oh King," he replied, "of the
great and famous forest temple of Llyn yr a
vanc" (on the site of the modern Beverley). "A
report came thither that certain strangers had
come to the Court of Iseur from some distant
land, to promulgate a foreign and damnable
heresy; and I, as being well versed in the truths
of our faith, and gifted with an eloquent tongue,
have been deputed by my brethren to attend this
conference, and aid, to the best of my ability, in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
discomfiting these foreign heretics, whose object
is to uproot our holy religion and substitute a
false theological creed."</p>

<p>"You are welcome!" said the King. "Take
your place among your brother Druids on my
right. Give heed to what the strangers have to
say, and reply to their arguments as your reason
and lengthened experience may dictate."</p>

<p>The stranger took the place indicated, and the
King bade the Apostles tell what they had to
say on the object of their mission, upon which
the eldest looking of the three, stretching forth
his arms as Raphael depicted Paul when preaching
at Athens, commenced his harangue by giving an
outline of the history of man as recorded in the
Scriptures, his fall from innocence and perfection,
by the seductions of the enemy of mankind, who
for his rebellious ambition had been banished
from heaven and cast down into hell, and who
since then had been going to and fro in the
earth tempting man to sin against his Maker,
in which he had been so successful that God
repented of having made man, and had caused all
mankind to perish save one family, and then
explained that afterwards, when the earth had
again become populated, he compassionated man's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
fallen estate, and had sent his Son to take on
himself the penalty due to man's transgression,
that all, through him, might be placed in a state
of salvation from that death eternal which they
inherited from the transgression of their first
ancestor; and wound up by imploring the King
and all present to abandon their impotent and
bloodthirsty gods, believe in the God of Mercy
whom they proclaimed, and accept the salvation
offered through the merits of Him who was
crucified.</p>

<p>The Druid, who had come afar, then rose and
craved permission to reply, which was granted,
and he stood forth on a mass of rock, with a
majestic presence and dignified air. He laughed
to scorn the fables which they had listened to,
which were only fit to delude the ears of silly old
women, and could not be accepted for a moment
by men endowed with the faculty of reasoning.
"We are told," said he, "that man was made
perfect, and was at the same time fallible; that
God is immutable, and yet repented; that a
creature, the work of His hands, has become His
rival, and from what we hear has become even
more potent than his Maker; has set up a rival
kingdom, and is able to wrest from the hands of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
God three-fourths of the beings whom He
creates, a God who is asserted to be omnipotent;
with many such subtle questions, inquiring&mdash;Can
these be compatible with reason, and can
you, as men of sense, believe them?" He then
descanted on the superior merits of the Druidical
religion, contrasting its "simple truth" with the
"absurd fables told us by these foreigners;"
concluding with a forcible and eloquent appeal
to those who listened to him not to abandon the
gods of their fathers, and go hankering after
strange gods, especially such as were recommended
by such baseless arguments and
improbable tales as they had just heard.</p>

<p>When he concluded a murmur of applause
agitated the assembly like a rustling of leaves in
the forest, and the King said, "Venerable
father, thou speakest well; thy words are those
of truth; and it only remains to bid these
strangers depart from our shores and return to
the land from whence they have come, bearing
with them our thanks for having come so far to
teach us what they conceive to be the truth, but
which we are unable to accept as consonant with
reason."</p>

<p>In the vehemence of his oratorical action, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
Druid had caught up the skirt of his robe, and
the apostle had spied protruding therefrom a
cloven foot, and moreover that the heat issuing
therefrom had caused the upper part of the rock
on which it was placed to become partially
liquefied, or rather gelatinised, so that it adhered
to the foot. Suspecting, therefore, whom he had
to deal with, he cried out on receiving the order
to depart, "Hearken, oh King, I have told you
of the arch-enemy of God and mankind, who
tempted the first man to sin, and still goes about
luring men to perdition; behold he&mdash;even he&mdash;is
present in this assembly, and has been
addressing you in advocacy of the false religion,
which you, in your ignorance, maintain. Him
will I unmask;" and addressing himself to the
Druid, he cried in a stern and commanding voice,
"Satan, I defy thee! in the name of the Saviour
of mankind, I command thee to display thyself in
thy proper person, and depart hence to the hell
from whence thou comest." In an instant, at
that adjuration, the Druid's robe and the
venerable beard fell from him, and he stood
revealed in all his hideous deformity, with a
malignant scowl on his countenance, and
springing up, he took flight, impregnating the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
air with a sulphurous perfume, carrying with
him a mass of rock, weighing several tons, which
adhered to his foot.</p>

<p>At this unanswerable demonstration of truth
of the religion proclaimed by the Apostles, the
King, and even the Druids, became converted,
and underwent the ceremony of baptism; and
the Apostles were empowered to go throughout
Brigantium and preach the Gospel, which
resulted in the conversion of multitudes, and the
Brigantes became a Christian people.</p>

<p>Satan, however, although foiled so signally, set
his wits to work to be avenged on the King for
deserting his standard. He recollected the piece
of rock which he had brought from Roulston and
dropped in his flight some seven or eight miles
from Iseur, the King's capital city, and this he
resolved upon making use of to destroy that city.
Accordingly he winged his way thither, and
splitting up the rock fashioned it into four huge
obelisk-like forms, and standing upon How-hill,
he hurled them at Iseur, crying out:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Borobrig, keep out of the way,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">For Auldboro town<br /></span>
<span class="i2">I will ding down."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>It may be observed <i>en passant</i> that there is a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
slight anachronism here, as Aldborough was not
so called until the Saxon age, and Boroughbridge
did not come into existence until after the
Conquest. But that is a matter of not much
consequence in a legend.</p>

<p>The stones which were thus intended to "ding
down" the King's city were miraculously intercepted
in their flight, falling and fixing themselves
firmly in the earth between the city and
the fords over the Ure (Boroughbridge), where
three of them, still called "The Devil's Arrows,"
may be seen at this day.</p>

</div><p><span class="dropletter">T</span><span class="smcap">he</span> stately Castle of Mulgrave, now
the home of the Phipps family&mdash;Marquises
of Normanby&mdash;was built
by Peter de Malo-lacu or de Mauley, in the reign
of King John. Cox says, "he built a castle here
for his defence, which, from its beauty and the
grace it was to this place, he named it Moultgrace,
but because it proved afterwards a great
grievance to the neighbours thereabouts, the
people, who will in such cases take a liberty to
nickname places and things by changing one
letter for another&mdash;c for v&mdash;called it Moultgrave,
by which name alone for many ages it
hath been and is now everywhere known, though
the reason thereof is by few understood." A
previous castle, with the barony, had been held
by the de Turnhams, and the last male heir,
Robert, having died without issue male, the
barony and castle were inherited by his only
daughter, Isabel, who, as was then the law<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
respecting heiresses, became a ward of the Crown,
and her hand at the disposal of the King. This
Peter de Malo-lacu, or Peter of the Evil Eye,
was a Poictevin of brutal and ferocious character,
who was made use of by King John as the instrument
for the murder of his nephew Arthur, for
which piece of service he rewarded the murderer
with the hand of the fair Isabel, with her
inheritance.</p>

<p>But long before the de Mauleys and the
de Turnhams, a noble Saxon family were lords of
the surrounding domain, and dwelt in a castle on
an eminence here, about three or four miles from
the seashore at Whitby. Leland says (<i>temp.</i> Hen.
8), "Mongrave Castel standeth on a craggy hille,
and on eche side of it is a hille far higher than
that whereon the castel standeth. The north
hille on the topp of it hath certain stones,
commonly caul'd Wadda's grave, whom the
people there say to have bene a gigant and owner
of Mongrave." And Camden, "Hard by upon a
steep hill near the sea (which yet is between two
that are much higher) a castle of Wade, a Saxon
Duke, is said to have stood; who, in the
confused anarchy of the Northumbrians, so fatal
to the petty Princes, having combined with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
those that murdered King Ethered, gave battel
to King Ardulph at Whalley, in Lancashire, but
with such ill-sucess that his army was routed and
himself forced to fly. Afterwards he fell into a
distemper, which killed him, and was interred on
a hill here between two solid rocks, about seven
foot high, which being at twelve foot distance
from one another, occasions a current opinion
that he was of gyant-like stature."</p>

<p>It is with this Duke Wada that we are
concerned. He appears to have been a Saxon,
or rather an Anglian noble of considerable
consequence in the kingdom of Northumbria, and
to have taken a conspicuous part in the political
movements of that troublous period, when, as
Speed narrates, "the Northumbrians were sore
molested with many intruders or rather tyrants
that banded for the soueraintie for the space of
thirtie years." He was a man of gigantic stature
and a champion of redoubtable energy in war,
dealing death around him and cumbering the
field with the bodies of those who had fallen
beneath the blows of his ponderous mace. He
was indeed a true son of Woden in all respects,
excepting that he had relinquished the hope of
banqueting in the halls of the Walhalia, and appropriating<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
the skulls of his enemies as drinking
vessels; for through the influence of St. Hilda's
Abbey of Streoneshalh, in the immediate vicinity,
he had adopted the tenets of, if he did not
regulate his life altogether according to, the
principles of Christianity.</p>

<p>Now Wada was a married man, and had a
helpmate of stature and proportions corresponding
with his own. They were a well-matched
couple, and seemed to have lived together in a state
of ordinary connubial happiness, there being but
one thing to disturb the even tenor of their lives,
and that was that the lady had to go in all sorts
of weather across a moor to milk her cows&mdash;a
long and dreary journey even in summer, along
the rough and stone strewn trackway, but more
especially in winter, when the snow was
frequently knee deep, and the bitter blasts of the
north-east wind came careering over the sea and
sweeping with relentless fury across the bleak
and shelterless moorland.</p>

<p>Wada's Castle was a massive structure of stone,
with round-headed unglazed windows, and a
turret which commanded a fine outlook over the
sea on one side, and the moorlands and Cleveland
hills on the other. The rooms were of large size,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
as befitted the abode of a giant, but presented
few of the appliances of comfort that are deemed
commonplace essentials now-a-days. The walls
were of bare stone, without drapery of any kind,
and no ornamentation excepting some zigzag
mouldings; the roofs were vaulted, and in those
of large size supported at the intersections by
one or more stunted round pillars; the windows
were small, without glass, and furnished with
wooden shutters to exclude the wind and rain in
the inclement seasons of the year; and the
furniture consisted of rough-hewn deal or oaken
tables, and shapeless benches or stools, with an
oaken coffer to hold valuables, and side shelves to
hold wooden platters and vessels of earthenware.
The fire in cold weather was made on the floor,
of logs of wood or cuttings of peat, the smoke
escaping as it could through the doorways or
windows.</p>

<p>It was in such a room as this that Wada and
his wife sat at breakfast, one rainy and boisterous
morning. After devouring an enormous quantity
of beef and swine's flesh, with manchets of oaten
bread, washed down by repeated draughts of
ale, Wada, wiping his mouth with the back of his
hand, rose and went to look forth at the weather.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span></p>

<p>Wada was not a ferocious giant, dragging
along half-a-dozen damsels, with one hand, by
their hair, to immure them in his dungeons, and
grind their bones to make his bread, as was the
wont of the Cornish giants of old; nor was he,
like them, stupid and weak-minded, so as to be
easily outwitted and destroyed by the immortal
Jack. On the contrary, although valiant in war,
he abused not his great strength by tyrannising
and oppressing his vassals, lived on good terms
with his neighbours, and was gentle and tender
in all his domestic relations. Hence, when he
looked through his window and saw the sea
foaming with wrath, and a few fisher-boats tossed
about by the waves in their endeavour to gain
shelter in Whitby Bay, and saw the sleet driving
across the moor, he heaved a sigh, saying,
"Methinks, sweetheart, thou wilt have a rough
passage over the moor this morning; would to
Heaven that it were not necessary for thee so to
do." "I care not much," she replied, "for the
falling rain and the boisterous wind, rough as
they may be, but experience more inconvenience
and suffering from the roughness of the road I
have to traverse daily, so bestrewn is it
with obstacles and stumbling-blocks, and so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
many bog-holes and quagmires have I to pass
through."</p>

<p>Now it chanced that a short while before this
Wada, in one of his wanderings, came upon the
road constructed by the Romans, from
Eboracum, by way of Malton to the Bay of
Filey, and was struck by the facilities it gave
for travelling, as compared with the more modern
Saxon roads, if roads they could be called, which
were mere trackways, formed and trodden down
by the feet of men and animals. When his wife
made the above reply, this recurred to his
memory, and after a few minutes musing, the
thought struck him&mdash;Why should not he make a
road on this pattern for the benefit of his wife,
whom he loved so dearly, and whose toil and
labours he would be glad to lessen at any cost to
himself?</p>

<p>After turning the matter over in his mind as
to the practicability of the project, he came to
the conclusion that it was perfectly feasible.
There was plenty of material close at hand, in
the shingle on the beach, and he had sufficient
strength and energy to level the inequalities and
fill up the boggy places, so as to make a firm
foundation, and to spread over the whole a layer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
of the stones gathered from the sea shore. Yes;
it was perfectly practicable, and could be
accomplished at the mere expense of a little
labour. He explained the project to his wife,
who was delighted with it, and undertook to
bring up the stones whilst he placed them in
position after forming the foundation.</p>

<p>They lost no time in commencing the work;
he with his spade in the levelling and bog-filling
operations, and she carrying up the shingle in
her apron; and it went on apace day after day
and week after week, soon presenting the
appearance of a newly macadamised road of
modern times, and was duly appreciated by Lady
Wada in her daily tramps across the moor.</p>

<p>It chanced that when the road was nearly
completed, in one of her journeys from the beach,
laden with shingle, her apron strings gave way
and her load fell to the earth, and there it was
left (some twenty cart-loads), and remained until
recent times as a monument of her industry and
strength, and an incontestable evidence of the
truth of the narrative. It was after this that
Wada joined in the insurrection against Ethelred,
the son of Moll, who, after his restoration from
exile, put to death the Princes Alfus and Alwin,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
sons of King Alfwald, who were the rightful
heirs to the crown, and repudiated his wife to
marry Elfled, the daughter of Offa, King of
Mercia, "which things," says Speed, "sate so
neere the hearts of his subjects that they
rebelliously rose in arms, and at Cobre miserably
slew him, the 18th day of April, the yeare of
Christ Jesus, 794." After which Wada and his
confederates were defeated in battle by Duke
Ardulph, one of the aspirants to the Crown, and
fled to his castle, where he died of a terrible
disorder, and was buried, as stated, between two
huge stones.</p>

<p>The road leading from Dunsley Bay towards
Malton still exists, and goes by the name of
"Wada's Causeway," and one of the ribs of
Wada's wife is preserved in the present Mulgrave
Castle, but the present age is so incredulous
in respect to the chronicles of the past that
there are sceptics who assert that it is nothing
more than the bone of a whale.</p>

<p>Wada was the ancestor of the widely ramified
family of Wade, one of whom, at least&mdash;Marshal
Wade&mdash;inherited the road-making skill of his
ancestor. After the rebellion of 1715 he was
sent into the Highlands as military governor,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
with the object of thoroughly subduing the
country and rendering it less available as a place
of refuge for rebels. With this view he
constructed a series of military roads, where
there had previously been only trackways, with
which the people were so delighted that they set
up a stone near Fort Augustus, with the
inscription:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"If you had seen these roads before they were made,<br /></span>

and its many palatial structures, devoted to
charitable and philanthropic purposes, due
chiefly to the benevolence of the Crossleys,
who, from a humble origin, have, within the
memory of living persons, become manufacturing
princes of the locality, and who, in consideration
of their mercantile enterprise and the philanthropic
use of the wealth they have acquired,
have been honoured with a baronetcy. It is one
of the most flourishing, or what Leland would
term "quick," towns of the Yorkshire clothing
district, and in recent times has increased rapidly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
in population, wealth, and importance. It is not
even mentioned in Domesday-Book, nor does
its name appear in any record until the twelfth
century, when Earl Warren made a grant of the
church to the priory of Lewes, in Sussex.
About the middle of the fifteenth century it consisted
of but thirteen houses, which during the
following hundred years increased to 520. In
1764, the parish, which, however, is very extensive,
being seventeen miles in length by an
average width of eleven, contained 8,244 families;
and in 1811 the population numbered 73,815,
that of the town being 9,159, since which period
of eighty years it has been more than nontupled,
the census of 1891 giving the population at
82,900.</p>

<p>The town of Halifax owes its prosperity to its
mineral wealth. It is certainly not the place for
the agriculturist or the cattle breeder. In an
Act passed <i>temp.</i> Philip and Mary, it is recited,
"whereas the parish of Halifax, being planted in
waste and moors, where the ground is not apt to
bring forth any corn or good grass, but in rare
places and by exceeding and great industry of
the inhabitants; and the same inhabitants
altogether do live by cloth making, and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
greatest part of them neither getteth corn nor is
able to keepe horse to carry wools, etc.;" and
Camden, in 1574, observes that there are 12,000
men in the parish, who outnumber the sheep,
whereas in other parts we find thousands of sheep
and but few men, "but of all others, nothing is so
admirable in this town as the industry of the
inhabitants, who, notwithstanding an unprofitable,
barren soil, not fit to live upon, have so
flourished in the cloth trade, which within these
seventy years they first fell to, that they are
both very rich and have gained a reputation for
it above their neighbours, which confirms the
truth of the old observation that a barren
country is a great whet to the industry of the
natives."</p>

<p>For the first three or four centuries after the
Conquest, England was a great wool-growing
but not a wool-manufacturing country. Sheep-breeding
was a great source of income to the
Cistercians, who, with all the private wool-growers,
exported their produce to the spinners and
weavers of the Low Countries. It was not until
King Edward III., with great sagacity, foreseeing
that England might manufacture as well
as produce the raw material, and thus share in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
the profits arising out of that industry, invited
over a number of Flemish artisans and settled
them in Norfolk and Yorkshire, prohibiting the
exportation of wool excepting under a tax of 50s.
per pack. This was the foundation of the
clothing industry of the West Riding, which has
since then expanded so enormously; and Halifax
was one of the first places to apply itself to the
spinning and weaving of wool. As stated above,
although poverty-stricken in an agricultural
point of view, it possessed great mineral wealth
in the shape of almost limitless deposits of coal,
which was a valuable essential even in those
primitive times, but which has become an absolute
essential since the introduction of steam-power
looms.</p>

<p>It is supposed that the manufacture was
introduced into Halifax about the year 1414;
but it was then on a very limited scale, and it
was not until the beginning of the eighteenth
century that the first great advance took place,
by the erection of looms for the weaving of
shalloons, everlastings, moreens, shags, etc., since
which time damasks, and more recently still,
carpets, have taken prominent places in the
industries of the town; indeed, Halifax has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
absorbed a considerable portion of the trade
which belongs legitimately to Kidderminster.</p>

<p>Although the town of Halifax is of comparatively
modern origin, the name is unmistakably
Saxon, indicating that previously to the Conquest
there was a village or hamlet of some description
to which that appellation was given. One tradition
asserts that there was a hermitage dedicated
to St. John the Baptist, in the valley, and that
within it was preserved the face of the saint,
which attracted vast numbers of pilgrims, and
caused the name of the place of resort to be called
Hali-fax, or Holy-face; and there may possibly
be some substratum of truth in this, as the parish
church is dedicated to the same saint. Dr.
Whitaker partially adopts this theory, but his
etymologies are frequently rather fanciful. He
refers to this hermitage of St. John, "whose
imagined sanctity attracted a great concourse of
people in every direction, to accommodate whom
there were four separate roads from different
points of the compass, which converged in the
valley, and hence the name Halifax, which is half
Saxon and half Norman, signifying the Holy-ways,
fax in Norman-French being an old plural
noun, denoting highways."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span></p>

<p>Camden gives a brief outline of the legend
given below, which he heard from the people of
the vicinity, adding&mdash;"and thus the little village
of Horton, or as it was sometimes called, 'The
Chapel in the Grove,' grew up to a large town,
assuming the new name of Halig-fax, or Halifax,
which signifies holy hair, for fax is used by the
English on the other side Trent to signify hair,
and that the noble family of Fairfax in these
parts are so named from their fair hair."</p>

<p>That the valley was esteemed a place of
peculiar sanctity in the early ages is a matter of
which there can be little doubt, and this is
sufficiently evidenced by one fact alone. Within
its precincts was born, about the end of the
twelfth or beginning of the thirteenth century,
John, the foremost mathematician of the age,
author of "Tractatus de Sphæri Mundi," "De
Computo Ecclesiastes," and "De Algorismo,"
who was honoured with a public funeral at the
expense of the University of Paris, who assumed
the name of Johannes de Sancto Bosco, or John
of the Holy Wood. And here it may be
incidentally noticed that the Holy Wood has
since then produced other men upon whom the
mantle of Johannes seems to have fallen. Here<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
was born, in 1556, Henry Briggs, the eminent
mathematician; Gresham, Professor of Geometry,
Savilian Professor at Oxford, and author of
"Arithmetica Logarithmica," an improvement
on Napier, containing logarithms of 30,000
natural numbers; Jesse Ramsden, the famous
optician, and improver of the Hadley quadrant,
who died <span class="smcap">A.D.</span> 1800; and at Horton, seven miles
distant, Abraham Sharpe, one of the best
mathematicians and astronomers of his time, who
died in 1742.</p>

<p>The shadows of evening were falling upon the
valley, and the outlines of the rugged, verdureless
hills were gradually becoming more and
more indistinct, as Father Aelred, having passed
out of his little chapel of St. John the Baptist,
where he had been performing the vesper service,
proceeded to his lonely habitation, and after a
simple meal of wild fruits and a draught of water
from the little streamlet trickling down the
hillside, sat him down to read for the hundredth
time a transcript of a portion of Cædmon's
Scriptural poems, after which he spent some time
in prayer and self-communion, and then cast
himself upon his sackcloth, which was spread
over a layer of rough gravel, to slumber for a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
short time, in this mortifying and penitential
fashion, to rise again at midnight for other
devotional exercises.</p>

<p>Father Aelred was a man of thirty or thirty-five
years of age, of pale countenance and
emaciated frame, with sunken eyes and hollow
voice, the result of rigorous fasting, long vigils,
mortification of the flesh, and severe penitential
exercises. In his boyhood he had been regarded,
from his gravity of aspect, love of learning, and
incipient piety, as one who was destined to
become a light of the church of the coming
generation, and was sent for his education to the
famous School of Streoneshalh, established by
the Lady Hilda, and at that time under the
superintendence of her successor, the Princess
Elfleda, where he imbibed Scriptural instruction
from the lips of the then venerable Cædmon, a
monk of the house. He became a novice of the
house, passed the requisite examinations satisfactorily,
and was in due course admitted as a
fully accredited member of the fraternity. The
strictness of his piety was such that he shortly
found the life of a monk not to answer his
longings for a higher life of holiness and a
position where he could be of service to the souls<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
of his fellowmen. He therefore left the shelter
of Whitby, and wandered about for some weeks,
until he came into the wild and barren-looking
mountainous district of the west, and finding
there a secluded valley, shut in by towering hills
and frowning rocks&mdash;a spot with a very sparse
and scattered population, and removed far away
from the noise and turmoil of the world&mdash;he
resolved to make it his home, and to settle down
in it as a hermit, shutting out all intercourse
with his fellowmen and women, save in the way
of imparting spiritual teaching and consolation to
the few simple unsophisticated rustics who dwelt
in the valley. He found a cavern in the
hillside, which he enlarged and fashioned into a
habitation wherein to live; fitting the entrance
with a door, to shelter him from the cold winter
winds and prevent the intrusion of wild animals,
above which he made an orifice for the admission
of light, which he glazed with a thinly scraped
sheet of horn, such as King Alfred's lanterns
were made of, and furnished the interior with
two sections of a tree trunk, the larger to serve
as a table, the smaller as a seat; a shelf on which
he kept his eatables, with a knife, an earthen
platter, and a drinking horn, a piece of rough<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
sackcloth for his bed, and over it, fixed to the
rock, a roughly-shapen cross, the emblem of his
faith, beside which hung a knotted rope for the
purpose of penitential flagellation. At a few
rods distance he erected with his own hands, from
timber cut by himself, a small chapel&mdash;a temple
of God, sufficiently rude and unpretentious in
point of architecture, but answering every
purpose for which it was intended, that of a place
of assembly for the simple and unlettered people of
the valley, where they might join in the worship
of God; and here Aelred every evening performed
divine service and catechised the small flock of
which he had constituted himself the pastor, and
on Sundays performed three full services, with a
sermon and the administration of the sacrament of
the Lord's Supper. And thus he came to be
looked upon in the district as a most holy man, as
indeed he was, and but little below a saint, who
might be expected any day to commence the
working of miracles, in the cure of the sick and
afflicted.</p>

<p>There was one peculiarity about Aelred's
character, which amounted almost to a monomania.
He entertained a shrinking horror of
fair-featured, beautiful women&mdash;not that there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
were many such in his solitary valley, they being,
as a rule, embrowned by exposure to the sun, and
their features corrugated by marks of rough toil
and the troubles of life even from girlhood, and as
such they experienced his sympathy and
Christian charity; and the little children were
always treated by him with tenderness and love,
in imitation of his Divine Master, who had said
"for of such is the kingdom of Heaven." But
for the vain and frivolous of the sex, who seemed
to deem nothing of supreme importance save the
adornment of their persons, he felt profound scorn
and contempt, mixed with a modicum of pity,
and marvelled why they were sent into the world
at all, unless, it might be, to test the virtue of
man by the temptation of their fascinating allurements.</p>

<p>It happened, however, that not far distant a
benevolent and wealthy lady had established a
religious home for females. It was not exactly a
nunnery, although it possessed many of the
features of one, the inmates not being debarred
from matrimony, although absolute chastity was
an essential while resident there; nor were they
garbed in unbecoming costumes, nor compelled to
sacrifice that pride and ornament of woman, her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
hair; besides which they were allowed a certain
amount of liberty in the way of visiting their
friends, which was not accorded to a regular
nun. The ladies of this establishment were wont
to go to Father Aelred to confess their little
peccadilloes, to which he saw no reasonable
objection, as they were generally very homely,
ill-favoured specimens of the sex, as is usually
the case with the inmates of nunneries, and thus
were in no way perilous to his chaste soul and
holy communings. Had they been otherwise, it is
probable that he might have declined the office
of father confessor to them, and closed the door of
St. John's Chapel against their intrusion.</p>

<p>It is a well-known psychological fact that the
body and the mind act and re-act upon each other
to their respective well-being or detriment, and
that if the one is neglected or abused the other
suffers in proportion; and this fact was evidenced
in the case of Father Aelred. As we have
observed, he was a man of intense and fervid
piety, the whole of his thoughts being concentrated
on one sole object&mdash;the salvation of his
own soul and that of his fellow-creatures. Hence
he fasted for prolonged periods, denied himself a
sufficient measure of sleep, such as nature<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
demanded, subjected himself to severe self-flagellations,
and in other ways outraged nature,
fancying that by these mortifications of the flesh
he was promoting the health of his soul. But
the laws of nature are never broken with
impunity, and he had to pay the penalty; instead
of invigorating he impaired the powers of the
spiritual portion of his dual entity, which,
although distinct from, is essentially interwoven
with the material half. At first he merely
experienced lassitude, depression of spirits, and a
harassing dread that after all his religious
aspirations and rigid observance of the duties of
the Church, he might find himself cast into the
bottomless pit at last. These were followed by
distressing dreams and visions of the Judgment
Day, the frown and sentence of the arbiter of his
eternal destiny, and the jeering scoffs of the
enemy of souls, as he passed into the region of
everlasting weeping and wailing. Deeming these
to be proofs of the weakness of his faith and the
languor of his religious life, he was led to redouble
the rigour of his asceticism, the natural result
being to intensify the malady he sought to cure.
From seeing fearful visions in his dreams at
night, he began to see horrible figures of demons<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
by day, who crowded about him, with scoffing
grimaces and leering looks, sometimes, as it
seemed to his ears, as if uttering threats and
sarcastic allusions to his assumed piety, or anon
indulging in demoniac yells of laughter. Of
course he attributed all these to the machinations
of the devil, and prayed for deliverance from
them; but he was haunted by them day and
night, with increasing persistency, until at length
the sanity of his mind gave way, and he became
in fact a maniac, not, however, so pronounced as
to render it evident to others, or prevent his
performance of his priestly offices, nor did he
relax his private devotional exercises.</p>

<p>On the evening above mentioned, when the
holy father returned home from the chapel and
sat down to the perusal of the transcript of
Cædmon, which he had brought from Whitby, he
was particularly disturbed in mind, and could not
concentrate his thoughts upon what he was
reading, which perpetually recurred at the
evening service in the chapel and the advent of a
new member of his congregation; besides which
an imp had squatted himself on the table
opposite him, and sat there grinning at him in a
most diabolical fashion. It was the usual custom<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
of the sisterhood of the religious house of which
mention has been made to attend his evening
service; and on this occasion a new member of
the sisterhood was present for the first time.
She had been just admitted as a novice, and was
young and beautiful, with the fair, clear
complexion, blue eyes, and long flaxen hair of the
Anglian race, a striking contrast to the elderly,
homely featured spinsters whom she accompanied.
The moment he caught sight of her face, Aelred
experienced a species of fascination, similar to
that of the bird in the presence of the serpent,
and although he battled with the feeling, he
could not shake it off. To his eyes, she seemed
like an angel come down from heaven, and the
more he struggled to avert his thoughts from
contemplating her celestial beauty, the more he
felt impelled to turn his eyes again and again to
where she sat. He felt it was wrong, so he
brought the service to an abrupt close and
hastened home to purify his soul, by prayer, from
what he deemed the lust of the eye. But the
vision was ever present in his mind's eye, so
much so that he scarcely heeded or was conscious
of the grinning imp on the table. He had
retired to his sackcloth couch, after a wholesome<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
application of the knotted rope and a prolonged
prayer before the cross, and eventually fell asleep,
but his dreams were all of the fair vision he had
seen in the chapel, and for that night he was not
haunted by his usual demon visitants.</p>

<p>A few days afterwards the Mother Superior of
the little convent came to the chapel for
confession, and brought with her her new
daughter, to whom she introduced Aelred as her
future father confessor, and it was with a strange
unusual throbbing of his heart that he looked
upon her fair form, as she bowed herself beneath
his paternal greeting; but when he listened to her
soft, silvery accents as she told him in confession
her little sins of thought, his heart softened
as it had never done before to any woman. These
feelings, however, involuntary as they were,
caused him much alarm, and he strove to banish
them as being perilous to his soul, but it was
impossible to drive the fair, and as he thought,
angelic, image from his mind. A week passed
by, to him a week of sad spiritual tribulation, for
when in prayer his mind wandered away; nor
was he able to fix his thoughts in contemplation,
the angelic vision ever rising up to distract and
perplex him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span></p>

<p>One day when she came to confess she said to
him&mdash;"Holy father, I have fallen into grievous
sin; I have made the probationary vow of
abstraction from the world and of devotion to the
sole service of God." "That is well, my
daughter," said Aelred; "persevere in that
resolution, and God will bless you both now and
for ever." "But, father," she continued, "I
have suffered a fearful lapse; I have looked back
upon the world, and have almost regretted
having taken the vows." "Backsliding," said
Aelred in reply, "is, as you term it, a grievous
sin; but it is remediable by prayer, penitence,
and fasting. But tell me more in detail the evil
thoughts which have assailed your soul." "I
almost fear to tell you," she answered. "Then
can I not advise you in the matter excepting in
general terms. Confide in me; it is but speaking
to God through me, and he will inspire me with
words of remedial comfort; otherwise I cannot
grant absolution."</p>

<p>Thus urged, she stated that previously to
entering the convent she scarcely knew what the
passion of love meant, but since then it had
sprung up in her heart with a vehemence that it
seemed to be impossible to suppress. She had seen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
one since she came into the valley, a pious and
godly man, who had at the first sight animated
her breast with the passion in so intense a degree
that it glowed and raged within her like a
furnace. The holy man at once concluded that
he himself was the person she referred to, and he
felt his heart beating wildly with an hitherto
unexperienced emotion, and at the same time his
brow became bedewed with perspiration, caused
by an apprehensive terror of the dangerous
position in which he found himself placed. He
stood silent and almost paralysed, looking down
upon her with fearful forebodings as to what she
would confess further, when she, wondering at his
silence, cast a furtive glance upward from her
hitherto downcast eyes. Everyone knows that
there is wondrous eloquence in the glance of a
female eye, and as her's met his, he felt at once
that it meant impassioned love&mdash;lawless love,
and it stirred up within his disordered mind all
the narrow bigotry of his sentiments in respect
to sexual love. He still stood silently gazing
upon her, when all at once a fearful idea flashed
across his mind, which caused him to pass at
once from a person of slightly distempered
intellect into a perfect madman. The idea was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
that the girl before him was none other than
Satan himself, who, not having been able to
tempt him to sin by means of his imps in their
repulsive demoniac forms, had assumed the
semblance of a lovely virgin to allure him to
carnal sin. Rising up to his full height, with
eyeballs glaring and features distorted with
indignant rage, he cried, "Satan, I know thee,
and I defy thee; but no more shalt thou tempt
man in that shape at least," and with that he dealt
her a violent blow, and she fell senseless on the
floor. "Ah!" cried he, "thou hast found thy
match in me, but my work is not yet completed;
thy head shall be placed aloft as a warning to
others," and with that he procured a knife and
severed her head from her body, which he then
took out and fixed on the trunk of a yew tree, just
where it begins to ramify, and when that was
completed he rushed up the mountain with wild
shouts of triumph and maniacal gesticulations.</p>

<p>The young novice not returning to the
convent, search was made for her, and her headless
body was discovered in the chapel, lying in a
pool of blood, but it was not until the following
day that the head was found fixed in the yew
tree. On attempting to remove it, it was found<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
that the long hair had taken root in the tree
trunk, and was spreading downwards in thin filaments,
and as this was looked on as a miracle, it
was left there. Suspicion of the murder attached
itself to the hermit-priest, and as he had been
seen going up the mountain in a distraught state
of mind, search was made for him in that direction,
and his body was found at the foot of a precipice
down which he had fallen, but whether through
accident or for the purpose of suicide could never
be known.</p>

<p>Camden says&mdash;"Her head was hung upon an
ew-tree, where it was reputed holy by the vulgar,
till quite rotten, and was visited in pilgrimage by
them, every one picking off a branch of the tree
as a holy relique. By this means the tree
became at last a mere trunk, but still retained its
reputation of sanctity among the people, who
believed that those little veins, which are spread
out like hair in the rind between the bark
and the body of the tree, were indeed the very
hair of the virgin. This occasioned such resort
of pilgrims to it that Horton, from a little village
grew up to a large town, assuming the name of
Halig-fax, or Halifax, which signifies holy hair."</p>

of which York was the capital,
presented in the seventh century one
almost continuous series of battles and murders,
massacres of the people, and desolation of the
land. Ethelfrid, grandson of Ida, founder of the
kingdom of Bernicia, and Eadwine, son of Ælla,
founder of that of Deira, succeeded their fathers
in their respective kingdoms about the same
time; but the former, who had married Acca,
Eadwine's sister, usurped his brother-in-law's
throne and drove him into exile, who afterwards,
by the assistance of Redwald, King of the
East Angles, in the year 617, defeated and
slew Ethelfrid in battle, and became King of
Northumbria and eighth Bretwalda, or paramount
monarch of Britain. He was converted
to Christianity, and Penda, the pagan King of
Mercia, in order to extirpate the heretical
religion, invaded Northumbria, and defeated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
Eadwine at Hethfield, who was slain in the fight.
This happened in 633, and Penda then went into
East Anglia on the same mission, leaving
Cadwalla, a Welsh Prince, his ally, although a
Christian, as Governor of Northumbria, who
made York his headquarters, and ruled the
people, especially those who had embraced
Christianity and were the most devoted adherents
of the family of Eadwine, with the most ruthless
barbarity. On the death of Ethelfrid, his sons,
Eanfrid and Oswald, fled into Scotland along
with Osric, son of Ælfrid, King Eadwine's uncle,
where they had been converted to Christianity
under the teaching of the monks of Iona, or, as
Speed puts it, "had bin secured in Scotland all
his (Eadwine's) reigne, and among the Red-shanks
liued as banished men, where they learned
the true Religion of Christ, and had receiued the
lauer of Baptisme." On hearing of the death of
Eadwine, they returned to Northumbria, were
welcomed by the people, and assumed the crowns&mdash;Osric
of Deira, and Eanfrid of Bernicia.
Cadwalla was still, however, potent in Northumbria,
holding York and tyrannising over the
people, and they were scarcely seated on their
thrones when he slew Osric in battle, and caused<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
Eanfrid to be put to death when he came before
him to sue for peace. Seeing that Christianity
was almost extinct in the land, the people having
reverted to the old faith, they both deemed it
expedient to renounce Christianity and restore
the worship of Woden, respecting which Bede
says, "To this day that year (the year during
which they reigned) is looked upon as unhappy
and hateful to all good men; as well on account
of the apostasy of the English Kings, who had
renounced the faith, as of the outrageous tyranny
of the British King. Hence it has been agreed
by all who have written about the reigns of the
Kings to abolish the memory of these perfidious
Monarchs, and to assign that year to the reign
of the following King, Oswald, a man beloved of
God."</p>

<p>Oswald was an altogether different man from
his brother Eanfrid, a man of genuine faith, who
had imbibed the true principles of Christianity,
sincere in his devotions, and prepared to undergo
any suffering, even death itself, rather than
apostatise from what he was fully convinced was
the truth. On the death of his brother he
collected around him a small army of devoted
followers, and with these advanced to meet<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
Cadwalla, relying on the justice of his cause, the
bravery of his handful of men, and the assistance
of God. He set up his standard, a cross,
emblematic of his faith, at Denisbourne, near
Hagulstad (Hexham), "and this done," says
Bede, "raising his voice, he cried to his army,
'Let us all kneel and jointly beseech the true
and living God Almighty, in his mercy, to defend
us, from the haughty and fierce enemy, for he
knows that we have undertaken a just war for
the safety of our nation.' All did as he had
commanded, and accordingly, advancing towards
the enemy with the first dawn of day, they
obtained the victory, as their faith deserved."
He adds, "In that place of prayer very many
miraculous cures have been performed, as a token
and memorial of the King's faith, for even to this
day many are wont to cut off small chips from
the wood of the holy Cross, which being put into
water, men or cattle drinking thereof or
sprinkled with that water are immediately
restored to health." He then gives some
instances, one of Bothelme, a brother of the
church of Hagulstad, which was afterwards built
on the spot, who broke his arm by falling on the
ice, causing "a most raging pain," when he was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
given a portion of moss from the then old cross,
which he placed in his bosom, and went to bed
forgetting that he had it, but "awaking in the
middle of the night, he felt something cold lying
by his side, and putting his hand to feel what it
was, he found his arm and hand as sound as if he
had never felt any such pain."</p>

<p>Cadwalla was utterly defeated and slain, and
his vast army (vast as compared with Oswald's
small band of heroes) cut to pieces and dispersed.
Having thus freed his country from the one disturbing
element, he applied himself to its
regeneration and restoration from anarchy and
desolation to peace and good order. First and
foremost, his object was the re-conversion of his
people from the paganism into which they had
lapsed, to Christianity, and to light afresh the
lamp of truth, which had been almost altogether
extinguished through the vigorous zeal of Penda
on behalf of his ancestral gods of the north.
With this object in view he sent to Iona for
missionaries, to preach and teach throughout
Northumbria, and Aidan was sent at the head of
a body of monks, whose headquarters were fixed
on the island of Lindisfarne, as resembling that
of Iona, from whence they came, hoping to make<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
it, like the latter, a centre of evangelical light to
the mainland of Northumbria. Here they lived
under the rule of Columba, the founder of Iona,
in monastic seclusion, when at home, which was
but seldom, as they were constantly on foot, staff in
hand, tramping about through forests and moors
and wild places of Oswald's kingdom. The King
created a bishopric, to comprehend the whole of
his territories, and constituted Aidan the first
Bishop, who, it is said&mdash;such was the zeal of his
subaltern monkish priests&mdash;baptised 15,000
converts in seven days. Besides this, the King
caused churches and monasteries to be erected in
various parts of his realm, and completed the
church which King Eadwine had commenced at
York, the forerunner of the magnificent fane
which now adorns that city and is one of the
most glorious specimens of Gothic architecture in
England. Nor was Oswald less active in civil
and secular matters, and in promoting the welfare
of his people. He governed his kingdom with
great wisdom and prudence, and under his peaceful
sceptre the land was rapidly recovering from
the effects of Cadwalla's desolating hand. He
was the fifth King of Deira, ninth of Bernicia,
third of Northumbria, and the ninth Bretwalda<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
or Supreme King of the island, "at which times
the whole Iland flourished both with peace and
plenty, and acknowledged their subjection vnto
King Oswald. For, as Bede reporteth, all the
nations of Britannie which spake foure languages,
that is to say, Britaines, Red-shankes, Scots, and
Englishmen, became subject vnto him. And yet
being aduanced to so Royall Majesty, he was
notwithstanding (which is maruellous to be
reported), lowly to all; gracious to the poore,
and bountifull to strangers."</p>

<p>It was a cold spring day; the sun shone
brightly, but imparted little warmth; the trees
were leafless, and the early flowers looked sickly
and languid, the effect of a long continuance of
north-easterly winds, which on this particular
day came coursing over the ocean, and were
roystering with boisterous glee and in fearful
gusts round the towers of Bamborough Castle,
and through the openings in the walls which
served the purpose of the glazed windows of after-times.
It was Easter-tide, and here King
Oswald had come from York, where he had kept
his Court, to celebrate this important festival of
the Church in the ancestral castle of his race.
The feast was laid in the banqueting-room, a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
tolerably large but gloomy and, to nineteenth
century eyes, a wretchedly appointed apartment,
with but few of the appliances of modern comfort.
A fire of wood burnt on the hearth, the smoke at
times passing up the wide chimney, at others
driven inward by a down-current of the wind, and
sent in curling wreaths along the vaulted roof.
The room was lighted by means of narrow recessed
openings and arrow slits, useful in times of siege,
but inconveniently narrow for the admission of
light, yet wide enough to afford free entrance to
the chilling wind. The walls were of bare stones,
and the furniture a table of rough planks running
down the centre, with a smaller cross table, on a
sort of dais. At the latter table were seated
King Oswald, with his Queen Kineburga,
daughter of Kingils, the sixth monarch and first
Christian King of the West Saxons, on the one
hand, and Bishop Aidan on the other. Along the
other table sat some nobles and thegns, three or
four of the monks of Lindisfarne, and below these
the house carles and outdoor retainers of the
King's household. On the cross table was placed
a large silver dish filled with venison, wild boar's
flesh, and other dainties; and distributed down
the long table were earthen dishes containing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
meat of various kinds, wooden platters and
knives, with drinking horns, and small loaves
of barley bread; and on the table stood flagons
of ale that had been brewed specially for the
festival.</p>

<p>At the King's request the Bishop pronounced
benediction on the food, with special reference
to Him in whose memory the festival was
celebrated, and who alone could administer the
bread of life. He had scarcely finished, and the
guests were beginning to handle their knives
preparatory to an attack on the smoking viands,
which gave forth a most appetising odour, when
a sound as of a multitude of persons outside
attracted their notice, and immediately after
voices were heard: "In the name of Him who
rose from the tomb this blessed morning, give us
whereof to eat, that we starve not and die by the
wayside." The King sent one of his house carles
out to inquire who and what they were, who
presently returned, saying that they were a band
of some dozen mendicants, formerly well-to-do
husbandmen, and their families, whose homes and
crops had been destroyed by Cadwalla's followers,
and that they were utterly destitute, deprived of
the means of living, and dependent on charity for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
food until they could find means to replace
themselves on their farms.</p>

<p>"Unfortunate creatures," exclaimed the King;
"a fearful retribution awaits that so-called
Christian prince in that world to which his
crimes have sent him through our instrumentality
by God's providence;" and, taking up
the large silver dish, continued, "It is better
that we celebrate not this festival, than that the
poor of our realm die of starvation. Take this,
Wilfrid, and portion out its contents among the
famishing crowd, and when they have eaten, cut
up the dish and distribute the fragments, that
they may have the wherewithal to procure food
on the morrow." Aidan, the Bishop, who was
afterwards canonised, was struck with admiration
at the pious and charitable act of the King,
which he warmly applauded; and taking hold of
his right arm, prayed that that arm and hand
which had passed forth the dish might never
become corrupt, but for ever remain fresh, in
token and remembrance of this pious act of self-abnegation;
and instead of feasting, this Easter
day was spent by Oswald, his Queen, and the
Bishop in fasting and prayer.</p>

<p>Penda, the pagan King of Mercia, was still<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
living, and still as inveterately hostile to the new
heresy as when he had made his raid on
Northumbria, and trampled it out by the defeat
and death of the Royal convert of Paulinus; and
now, when Oswald had been eight years on the
throne; had brought his kingdom, by wisdom
and good government, into a condition of peace
and prosperity; and had re-established Christianity
on a sure and firm basis, he heard with some
dismay that the heathen King was muttering
threats against him, and gathering his forces
together for another invasion, and a second
suppression of the religion that sought the
dethronement of Woden as the god of heaven.
Yet although he heard these tidings with dismay,
he felt assured of the Divine protection, remembering
how signally he had defeated Cadwalla
by fighting under the standard of the Cross,
despite the disparity of numbers. He remembered,
too, what miseries were inflicted on the
Northumbrians by the marching of hostile bands
to and fro, leaving, as they usually did, a desert
behind them strewn with the corpses of men,
women, and children; and he determined that,
rather than allow his people to be subjected again
to these sufferings, he would be beforehand with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
the enemy and carry the war, with its resultant
ravages, into his own land. He therefore hastily
assembled his fighting men, and again uplifting
the standard of the Cross marched into Mercia,
his troops, like those of Cromwell a thousand
years afterwards, singing psalms and anthems as
they passed along.</p>

<p>Penda had collected together a large army,
and the rival hosts met at Masserfield, in the
modern Shropshire. They rushed towards each
other in mortal conflict, the one with shouts of
"Hallelujah!" the other with cries of "Aid us,
great Woden, thou mighty god of battle!" The
fight was long and obstinately contested, and
victory seemed to waver from one side to the
other until towards evening, when an arrow
struck Oswald and he fell to the ground, although
not mortally wounded; but a cry arose amongst
his followers that he was slain, and, thinking that
their God had deserted them, they were stricken
with panic, threw down their arms, and fled in
every direction, hotly pursued by the Mercians,
who mercilessly killed all the fugitives whom
they overtook.</p>

<p>Although stricken down and faint from loss of
blood, Oswald still lived, and witnessed with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
anguish of mind the cowardly and ignominious
flight of his army. The Mercians came over the
field, killing those of the fallen who were merely
wounded; but when they came to Oswald they
spared him, whom they had recognised, and
brought him, with staggering steps and downcast
heart, into the presence of their chief.</p>

<p>"Thou art he, then," said Penda, addressing
him, "who darest to invade my dominions&mdash;the
dominions of a descendant of Woden&mdash;thou,
a worshipper of false gods!"</p>

<p>"It is even I," replied Oswald, in a weak
voice; "I, Oswald, King of the Northumbrians,
successor to the sainted Eadwine, who is now
standing by the throne of the one true God,
Jehovah, the God whom I worship, on whose
arm I put my trust, and who, if He, in His
inscrutable providence, hath delivered me up to
thy cruel behests, will save my soul, that portion
of me, my real self, which thou cannot touch, and
bring me to dwell with Him for ever, in that
heaven which thou canst never reach, unless thou
repentest and abandonest thy false demon-gods,
who can only conduct thee to the flames of
hell."</p>

<p>"Blaspheming heretic," cried Penda, "I care<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
not for the heaven thou speakest of; sufficient for
me will be the Halls of Walhalla, where, amid
everlasting banqueting, I will use thy skull as
my drinking-cup. Still, I will give thee one
chance of life. Renounce thy false god; restore
the worship of Woden in Northumbria, and thou
shalt be replaced on thy throne as my tributary,
whilst I, as monarch of Mercia, Northumbria,
and East Anglia, extending from the Thames to
the Forth, and from sea to sea, shall become the
Bretwalda of Britain."</p>

<p>"Never, O King," replied Oswald "will I
prove recreant to the truth. Thou mayest rend
my sceptre from my grasp; thou mayest slay my
kindred and massacre my people; thou mayest
torture me, and put an end to my temporal
existence; but never will I renounce that faith
which affords me a secure hope of everlasting
blessedness, whilst thou, if thou continuest the
instrument of false gods, shalt be weeping and
gnashing thy teeth in the torments of the bottomless
pit."</p>

<p>"Then," roared out Penda, "thy death be on
thy own head. Soldiers, hew the blasphemer
to pieces!" And immediately he was stricken
by half-a-dozen swords, and fell exclaiming,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
"Lord Jesus, into thy hands I commend my
soul."</p>

<p>The ferocious pagan, kicking the body with
his foot as the last insult, gave directions for it to
be cut into fragments, and scattered abroad to be
devoured by birds of prey and the wild beasts of
the forest; and his behests were at once carried
into execution. And the birds and the beasts
gathered together to the horrible carnival, and
soon there was nothing left but the bare bones,
saving one arm, which none of them would touch,
and it remained entire and perfect as in life.</p>

<p>Some time after the battle of Masserfield the
arm of the King was found, fresh and undecayed,
and was conveyed to Northumbria and
deposited in a magnificent shrine, where it
remained uncorrupted for nine centuries, at first
in the chapel of St. Peter, Bamborough Castle,
and afterwards, when the Danes began to ravage
the coast, in the monastery of Peterborough,
whither it was removed, as Ingulphus informs us,
for safety. The scattered bones were afterwards
collected, by the pious care of Offryd, Oswald's
niece, the daughter of Oswy, the illegitimate
half-brother of Oswald, his successor on the throne
of Northumbria, and slayer of Penda in battle.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
She had become Queen of Mercia by her
marriage with Ethelred, son and successor of
Penda, who, after his father's death, had
embraced Christianity. She placed the relics in
the monastery of Bardney, in Lincolnshire, and
his "standard of gold and purple over the
shrine;" but when the Danes became troublesome
in Lindsey they were removed to Gloucester,
"and there, in the north side of the vpper end of
the quire of the cathedrall church, continueth a
faire monument of him, with a chappell set
betwixt two pillers in the same church." At all
these places&mdash;Masserfield, afterwards called
Oswestry, after the martyr; at the place of
burial of the relics; and at the shrines of the
uncorrupted arm&mdash;throughout those nine hundred
years some most wonderful miracles were
performed, which are duly recorded in the pages
of Bede and other writers; even a few grains of
the dust which settled on the shrine of the arm,
when mixed with water and drunk, were a
sovereign specific for almost any disease.</p>

<p>Winwick, in Lancashire, disputes with
Oswestry the claim of having been the place of
St. Oswald's death, as there is St. Oswald's Well
there; and from an inscription in the church it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
appears to have been anciently called Masserfelte;
moreover there is a tradition that he had a
palace there, which was within his dominions,
although his usual places of residence were
Bamborough and occasionally York.</p>

<p>The village of Oswaldkirk, near Helmsley,
derives its name from him, and there are several
churches in Yorkshire and elsewhere dedicated to
him.</p>

</div><p><span class="dropletter">S</span><span class="smcap">t.</span> Hilda was the nursing-mother of the
infant Saxon Church; the instructress
of Bishops; the preceptrix of scholars
and learned men; and the patroness of Cædmon,
the first Saxon Christian poet&mdash;the Milton of his
age. The Abbey over which she ruled with so
much piety and prudence was, during her life and
afterwards, one of the great centres of civilization
and Christian light of the kingdom of Northumbria,
and diffused its rays, beaming with celestial
radiance, even beyond the bounds of that great
northern monarchy.</p>

<p>She was a scion of the royal race of Ælla, the
founder of the kingdom of Deira, or Southern
Northumbria; the daughter of Hererick (nephew
of Eadwine, King of Northumbria), by his wife
the Lady Breguswith; was born in the year 614,
and died in 680. She was converted to Christianity
by the preaching of Paulinus, and was
baptised along with her great-uncle and his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
court, in 627. Six years afterwards Eadwine
was slain in battle by Penda, the heathen King
of Mercia, and the nascent religion of Christianity
stamped out, Paulinus flying for shelter with the
widowed Queen and her children, to the court of
her brother, the King of Kent. What became
of Hilda during this period of anarchy we know
not; but it seems evident that the afflictions and
persecutions she underwent served only to deepen
her faith and cause her to cling more closely to
the Cross of Christ.</p>

<p>In 647, when she was thirty-three years of age,
she resolved upon devoting her life entirely to the
service of God, and with that view journeyed into
East Anglia, where her nephew Heresuid reigned
as King, and where her cousin, the pious Anne,
resided. Her intention was to proceed hence to
Chelles, in France, to join her sister, St. Herewide,
who had retired to a nunnery there; but for
some reason or other she lingered for twelve
months in East Anglia. At the end of this
period she was granted a plot of land on the
Wear, upon which she erected a small house and
resided there, in modest seclusion, for the space
of a year, when the fame of her piety having
spread abroad, she was appointed Abbess of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
Hartlepool, a nunnery founded by Hein, the
first woman who assumed the nun's habit in
Northumbria, and who had now retired to the
nunnery of Calcaceaster (Tadcaster). In her new
capacity she set about her work with devoted
zeal, regulating the discipline, reforming abuses,
promulgating new and wholesome rules, and
enforcing a strict attention to religious duties, in
which she was aided by the counsels of her friend
Aidan, Bishop of Lindisfarne, who, at the
instance of King Oswald, had come from Iona to
re-convert his subjects to the faith which had
been trampled out by Penda.</p>

<p>In the year 642, Oswald, the second founder of
Christianity in Northumbria, fell, like his
predecessor Eadwine, under the ferocious sword
of Penda, and was succeeded by Oswy in Bernicia,
and Oswine in Deira; but in 650, Oswy caused
the king of Deira to be murdered, and assumed
the sceptre of Northumbria, north and south.
Five years after this, Penda, with unabated zeal
for his god&mdash;Woden&mdash;again made an inroad into
Northumbria, with the intent of slaying the third
Christian king of that realm. At first Oswy
attempted to buy him off by bribes, but the
Mercian potentate refused his offers, declaring<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
that nothing would content him but the death
of the King, and the utter extirpation of
Christianity. "Then," said Oswy, "if the pagan
will not accept our gifts, we will offer them to
one who will&mdash;the Lord our God;" and he
prepared for battle, making a vow that if God
would vouchsafe him the victory he would erect
a monastery, endow it with twelve farms, and
dedicate his newly-born daughter to holy
virginity and His service. With a comparatively
small force, he marched against Penda,
"confiding in the conduct of Christ," met him
near Leeds, and, as the Saxon chronicle says,
"Slew King Penda, with thirty men of the
Royal race with him, and some of them were
kings, among whom was Ethelhere, brother of
Anne, King of the East Angles; and the
Mercians became Christians."</p>

<p>This great and decisive victory, the last conflict
in England between heathendom and Christianity,
was the turning-point in Hilda's career of
eminence. Had Penda again been the victor,
Northumbria would again perhaps have lapsed
into paganism, and the future saint never have
been heard of beyond the vicinity of Hartlepool.</p>

<p>As it was, King Oswy, mindful of his vow,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
erected a monastery at Streoneshalh, on the bank
of the Esk, where it falls into the sea in Whitby
Bay. It was placed on a lofty headland, with a
steep ascent from the little fishing hamlet at its
foot and a precipitous escarpment to the sea. It
was formed for both male and female recluses,
and the fame of Hilda for piety and judicious
government was such that she was selected by
the King as the most fitting for the government
of the establishment. Under her rule
Streoneshalh became not only a model monastic
house, but a great school of secular and theological
learning. During her superintendence,
not less than five of her scholars attained the
mitre, all of them illustrious prelates of the
Saxon Church&mdash;St. John, of Beverley; St.
Wilfrid, of Ripon; and Bosa, Archbishops of
York; Hedda, Bishop of Dorchester; and
Oftfor, Bishop of Worcester. "Thus," says
Bede, "this servant of Christ, whom all that
knew her called 'mother,' for her singular piety
and grace, was not only an example of good life
to those that lived in her monastery, but afforded
occasion of amendment and salvation to many
who lived at a distance, to whom the fame was
brought of her industry and virtue." Fuller<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
observes, "I behold her as the most learned
female before the Conquest, and may call her the
she-Gamaliel at whose feet many learned men
had their education." During her Abbacy, the
famous Synod, convened by King Oswy, was
held within the walls of Streoneshalh, to settle
the vexed questions of the time for the celebration
of Easter, and of the tonsure, which were subjects
of warm dispute between the ancient British
Church and that of Rome, the Northumbrians
adhering to the former, as inculcated by the
missionary monks of Iona, who had been brought
hither by Oswald, and who now occupied the sees
of York and Lindisfarne. The King, who had
been educated in Scotland, and consequently held
to the British modes, presided, whilst his son,
Prince Alfred, who had been in Rome, supported
the Romanist views.</p>

<p>On the British side were ranged the Abbess
Hilda, Colman, Bishop of Lindisfarne, and the
venerable Cedd, Bishop of the East Saxons; on
the Romanist, Agilbert, Bishop of the West
Saxons, Wilfrid of Ripon, then a priest, Romanus,
and James the Deacon. The dispute was settled
in favour of the Romish rule, chiefly through the
eloquence and force of argument of Wilfrid, who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
afterwards made so conspicuous a figure in the
Northumbrian Church; and Colman, with his
British clergy returned to Iona. The Abbess
was as famous for miracles as for her other
qualities. On the coast of Whitby are found
great numbers of specimens of the petrified Cornu
Ammonis, commonly called snake stones, resembling
as they do coiled-up snakes, without heads.
This is how their origin is accounted for. When
the Abbey was first built, the neighbourhood was
infested by snakes, which were a great annoyance
to the brethren and sisters of the monastery, and
the Abbess, by means of prayer, caused them all
to be changed into stone.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"And how, of thousand snakes, each one<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Was changed into a coil of stone<br /></span>
<span class="i4">When holy Hilda prayed:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Themselves, within their holy bound,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Their stony folds had often found,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They told how sea fowls' pinions fail,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As over Whitby's towers they sail,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And, sinking down, with flutterings faint,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They do their homage to the saint."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The Abbess founded some cells in divers places
dependant on the Abbey, one of which was at
Hackness, near Scarborough, which she made use
of as a retreat from the bustle and cares of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
Streoneshalh, where she could, undisturbed,
devote her time more strictly to the exercises of
fasting, prayer, and meditation, returning to her
duties at the Abbey refreshed and invigorated
spiritually, and the better enabled to undergo the
distractions incident to her position as head of a
community of differing and often perplexing
temperaments. To these cells also she frequently
sent her nuns, to give them an opportunity for
cultivating closer communion with God, for their
spiritual edification.</p>

<p>For the last six years of her life the Abbess
suffered greatly from severe indisposition, which
frequently laid her prostrate for weeks together,
"Yet during all this time she never failed to
return thanks to her Maker, or publicly and
privately to instruct the flock committed to her
charge, admonishing them to serve God in health,
and thank Him for adversity or bodily infirmity."</p>

<p>Among the nuns under her care was one from
Ireland named Bega, who was most exemplary in
her attention to the duties of her religious calling,
eminently endowed with spiritual grace, and
conspicuous for her humility, self-abnegation, and
all the virtues which adorn a Christian life;
which qualities endeared her to the venerable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
Abbess, and they came to regard each other as
mother and daughter rather than as Lady
Superior and ordinary nun of a religious establishment.</p>

<p>During the long illness of the Abbess, Bega
was her constant attendant and nurse, and
accompanied her in her occasional retreats at
Hackness. One afternoon they were seated
together in the Abbess's private room, when the
invalid seemed to be rallying in health and
entering upon one of her alternate periods of
comparative convalescence. Bega had been
reading to her a new paraphrase of a portion of
the Bible, the composition of Cædmon, the
cow-boy poet of Streoneshalh. She laid down
the manuscript at the conclusion, expressing a
hope that the Abbess had not been wearied by
her imperfect reading, and that in spite of defective
knowledge of the characters on the part of
the reader, she had been enabled to follow the
sense and appreciate the beauty of the rendering.</p>

<p>"Nothing from the pen of Cædmon," said the
Abbess, "ever wearies me; on the contrary, his
compositions are so redolent of spiritual beauty
that they seem to refresh my soul, and invigorate
my body as well. Indeed, at this moment I feel<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
so much better in health that if no relapse occurs
in the interval, I propose on the morrow relieving
our good Prioress from the duties which I have
delegated upon her during my sickness."</p>

<p>"Happy am I," replied Bega at hearing this,
"and I trust that God, if he sees fit, may preserve
you for many years to come, in the superintendence
and guidance of this holy house. But,
mother dear, your restoration of bodily strength
emboldens me to solicit a boon."</p>

<p>"What is it my dear child? Anything that I
can grant shall be yours. I promise this without
knowing what you wish, feeling assured that you
will solicit nothing that is inconsistent either with
your maidenly character or with your altar-made
vows."</p>

<p>"I pray for nothing unbeseeming my character
in such respects; but, holy mother, of late I fear
I have experienced some spiritual declension, and
that I have become more carnally minded than
becomes one whose thoughts should be centred
on Christ alone, and I pray you, mother dear,
to permit me to retire into more entire seclusion
from the world, that I may by abstinence,
prayer, and close communion with God, be
restored to a more wholesome frame of soul."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span></p>

<p>"Your boon is granted, my child, gladly;
repair at once to Hackness, and may God shed
his blessing upon your pious aspiration for a
higher life of holiness."</p>

<p>The following day Bega was escorted to the
cell, where the Abbess, with an almost Cistercian
eye for sylvan beauty, had planted it, that in the
midst of a natural Paradise it might bloom as a
spiritual Eden, and there she at once commenced
a season of wholesome asceticism and religious
exercises.</p>

<p>A week passed away, and Bega, absorbed in
her devotional exercises, had become emaciated
by the rigour of her fasting without heeding it;
and as is usual in such cases, her spirit had
become more etherealised and more susceptible of
supernatural influences. After vespers one
evening she returned to her lonely sleeping
apartment, a bare and scantily furnished room,
and lay down on her bed, consisting of a thin
layer of straw on a hard, wooden pallet, with
nothing more than a coarse rug for her coverlet.
She slept for a short space, then awoke and rose
to repeat the nocturnes, kneeling on the rough
flooring stones. She then lay down again and
composed herself to sleep, and was in the half-conscious<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
state between sleeping and waking
when she was aroused by hearing a passing-bell
boom forth, which sounded like that of Streoneshalh,
which was miles beyond earshot, and was
the more remarkable as the bell of Hackness was
much smaller and altogether different in tone.
She listened with soul-thrilling awe, and thought,
"Can it be that the holy mother is departing at
this moment to her heavenly rest, and that the
sound of the passing-bell is miraculously brought
to mine ears?" Scarcely had the thought flashed
across her mind, when, looking upward, the
vaulted roof seemed to be melting away, like a
mist under the influence of the morning sun. In
a very short space of time it disappeared
altogether, and there was presented to the eye of
the gazer the expanse of sky studded with stars,
sparkling like clusters of diamonds. Presently
the knell of the passing-bell ceased. And there
broke upon her ear the sound of distant vocal
music. As it came nearer, it seemed different
from any music she had ever heard; unearthly;
heavenly; so ravishingly sweet was the melody.
The words she was unable to comprehend, but
there was something about them which seemed to
declare them of celestial origin. With raptured<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
ears she listened as the choir, which appeared to
be floating in the air, came on and on until it
sounded as if immediately overhead.  All
this while, too, a constantly increasing effulgence
of supernatural light was diffusing itself over the
firmament, and when the music came into close
proximity to the cell, there burst upon her sight
a vision, the glory of which she could have
hitherto formed no conception of. It was that of
a convoy of angels, fairer and more lovely in form
and feature than anything ever conceived by
artist or poet, or than ever trod the earth. It
was they who were chanting the divine melody
as they floated along overhead with an upward
tendency; and in their midst was the beautified
soul of the sainted mother of Streoneshalh, which
they were escorting to the everlasting realms of
purity and peace; of eternal rest, and an endless
duration of unalloyed happiness. The rapt eyes
of Bega were not allowed to rest long on this
celestial vision; the group ascended higher and
higher; the voices became fainter and fainter,
until they were altogether lost; and Bega
overcome with emotion, fell into an ecstatic
trance, and when she awoke from it there
was nothing to be seen but the glimmer of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
the moonshine on the walls and roof of her
cell.</p>

<p>The next day a messenger arrived announcing
the death of the Abbess, which he stated
occurred immediately after nocturnes on the
preceding night.</p>

<p>Bega remained a little while at Streoneshalh,
and then went into Cumberland, and provided a
religious house, called after her, St. Bees, where
she spent the remainder of a most holy life.</p>

</div><p><span class="dropletter">T</span><span class="smcap">wo</span> thousand years ago, what is now
the East Riding of Yorkshire was
chiefly forest land, with the exception
of the Wold uplands, which were pastures,
almost destitute of trees, having some semblance
to the swelling and rolling waves of the ocean,
where the Brigantes fed their flocks and herds,
where they dwelt in scattered hamlets, and where
they now sleep in their multitudinous tumuli. In
the lowlands at the foot, the forest was very
dense, and was the home of wolves, boars, deer,
and other wild animals, which were hunted by
the natives, who fed upon their flesh and clothed
themselves with their skins. This was called
the forest of Deira, and in one spot by the river
Hull, a few miles distant from the Humber, was
a cleared space, with an eminence in the midst,
and at its foot, extending westward, a pool of
water, afterwards a marsh or moor, and since
drained, forming now a portion of the town of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
Beverley, its former condition being indicated by
two parallel streets&mdash;Minster-moorgate, the
place of the moor by the Minster; and Keldgate,
the place of springs. This was a Druidical
open air temple, where the mystical rites of
Druidism were performed.</p>

<p>When the primitive Christian religion was
introduced into Britain, it is presumed that a
Christian church was established here, on the
rising ground by the lake, as the early Christians
built their churches, where practicable, on spots
held sacred by the people, which supposition
seems to be confirmed by the express statement
that St. John rebuilt, not built, the church in
Deira Wood. This early church, doubtless a
very rude affair of timber and thatch, was
destroyed or allowed to fall into ruin when the
Saxons and Angles overspread the land and
replaced the religion of Christ by that of Odin.
It might possibly be repaired during the short
period after the second introduction of Christianity
by Paulinus and the conversion of King
Eadwine, but, if so, would be again destroyed a
few years after, under the desolating hands of
Penda of Mercia, and Cadwalla, as it lay in ruins
until the beginning of the eighth century, when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
it was restored on a grander scale by John, Archbishop
of York.</p>

<p>St. John, the learned and pious prelate, one of
the brightest luminaries of the Saxon Church,
was a member of a noble Saxon family, a native
of Harpham on the Wolds. He was born in the
year 640, studied in the famous Theological
School of St. Hilda at Streoneshalh, and became
successively Bishop of Hagulstat (Hexham) and
Archbishop of York, which latter see he held,
with unblemished reputation and great usefulness,
for a period of more than thirty-three years.</p>

<p>He was almost incessantly employed in going
about his vast diocese, rectifying abuses,
regulating disordered affairs, exhorting the lax,
and commending the faithful. In one of these
visitations he came to the place in the forest of
Deira which had been, half a millennium
previously, the Llyn-yr-Avanc of the Celts, and,
according to some antiquaries, the Peturia of the
Romans, a conjecture which is supported by the
discovery of a tesselated pavement and other
Roman remains, where he found the ruins of the
old primeval British Church. The beauty and
seclusion of the spot struck him as being
eminently fitted for the establishment of a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
monastery, and probably the thought flashed
across his mind that hither he would like to
retire, in his declining years, to finish his life,
after the cares and anxieties of his prelateship, in
the calm of cloistered existence and in the
company of a pious brotherhood.</p>

<p>He did not allow the idea to pass away from
his thoughts, but soon after made arrangements
for carrying it out. He rebuilt the choir of the
old church, founded a monastery of Black Monks,
of the order of St. Columba, and an oratory for
nuns, south of the church, which afterwards was
converted into the parish church of St. Martin;
erected the church of St. Nicholas, in the manor
of Riding; placed seven secular priests and other
ministers of the altar in the head church, and
appointed Brithunus the first Abbot of the
monastery, with superintendence over the other
establishments. In 717, he resigned his see,
being then feeble and oppressed by the infirmities
of age, and retired to his monastery, where he
died in 721, and was buried in the porch at the
eastern end of the church.</p>

<p>After St. John, the next greatest benefactor to
the church and town of Beverley was Athelstan
the Great, King of Saxon England. Indeed, he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
may be considered the founder of the secular,
as St. John was of the ecclesiastical, town. The
town and church had been destroyed by the
Danes in 867, but a few years after the dispersed
canons and monks returned, and repaired, as far as
they could, their ruined buildings, so as to be
able to continue the celebration of the services;
but they remained in a dilapidated state for
nearly half a century, when Athelstan laid the
foundations of the future grandeur of the church,
and of the commercial importance of the town.
He had heard of the sanctity of St. John, and
the wonderful series of miracles he had performed,
both during his life and after his death, and
having occasion to chastise Constantine, King of
Scotland, for abetting the Danish Anlaf of Northumbria
in an invasion of that portion of his
dominions&mdash;for he had by conquest added
northern England to his government, and was in
truth the first King of England, rather than
Egbert&mdash;he visited Beverley on his march to
Scotland, and implored the aid of the Saint,
leaving his dagger on the altar as a pledge that,
if successful, he would bestow princely benefactions
on the church and town. By the assistance
of St. John, who appeared to him in a vision, he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
was the victor in the decisive battle of Brunnanburgh,
and nobly he kept his word. He made the
church a college of secular canons; endowed it
with four thraves of corn from every plough in
the East Riding; and made it a place of
sanctuary, as a refuge for criminals, with a stone
frid-stool, still in the Minster. He granted a
charter to the town, constituting it the capital of
the East Riding, with many privileges and
extraordinary rights; in consequence of which
opulent merchants flocked to the town, and it
soon began to flourish mightily, and became one
of the wealthiest and most important of the trading
towns of the realm. He also assigned the manor
to the Archbishops of York, who built a palace
there on the south of the church; vied with each
other in their patronage of the town, and
in adding to and endowing the collegiate
church.</p>

<p>In the beginning of the eleventh century
Archbishop Puttock added a chancellor, a
precentor, and a sacrist to the establishment,
and erected a costly shrine for the relics of St.
John, to which they were translated with great
pomp in 1037. Archbishop Kinsius erected a
western tower to the church, and Aldred, who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
held the see at the time of the Conquest, rebuilt
the choir, and ornamented it with paintings and
other decorative work, completed the refectory
and dormitory of the monastery, and increased
the number of canons from seven to eight,
changing them at the same time from canons to
prebendaries.</p>

<p>At this time&mdash;the period of the Conquest and
of the legend&mdash;we may assume from the usual
characteristics of the church architecture of the
time, that the church was an oblong building of
two stories, divided into a nave and chancel, with
a low tower at the western end. There would
probably be a lower and an upper range of
circular-headed windows, with doorways of the
same character, decorated with zigzag mouldings,
and in the interior would be a double row of
massive stunted columns, supporting semi-circular
arches, and at the eastern end, in the chancel,
the superb shrine of St. John, which was
attracting pilgrims from all parts, and was
beginning to be encrusted with the silver and the
gold and the gems, bestowed for that purpose by
the pilgrims in grateful remembrance of wonderful
cures effected upon them by the miracle working
of the saint. Such would most probably be the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
church in which occurred the incidents narrated
in our legend.</p>

<p>When the Norman Duke William had won the
battle of Hastings, and subdued southern and mid
England, and had been crowned King in the
place of the slain Harold, he discovered that
he was not really King of England, but of a
part only&mdash;that portion north of the Humber,
forming the old Saxon kingdom of Northumbria
of the Heptarchy, and one of the Vice-Royal
Earldoms of Saxon England, continuing to
maintain its independence with stubborn tenacity;
and it was not until after much bloodshed that he
overcame the sturdy Northumbrians of a mixed
Anglian and Danish race, and garrisoned York,
the capital, with a Norman garrison to keep the
province in subjection. No sooner, however, was
his back turned than the people, under Gospatric,
Waltheof, and other Danish and Saxon leaders,
broke out afresh in insurrection, massacred
the Norman garrison at York, and vowed to drive
that people and their Duke, the usurper of
Harold's throne, from Northumbria at least, if not
from England altogether. It was after one of
the most formidable risings that the Conqueror
swore that "by the splendour of God" he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
would utterly destroy and exterminate the
Northumbrians, so that no more rebellions should
rise to trouble him in that quarter of his
dominions; and with this view he marched northwards,
crossed the Humber&mdash;probably at Brough&mdash;and
encamped at a spot some seven miles westward
of Beverley, purposing to proceed
henceward to York on the morrow.</p>

<p>On his road from the Humber to his encampment
he had burnt the villages and crops, and
slain the villagers who came in his way, but the
majority, taking the alarm, fled to Beverley,
hoping to find safety within the limits of the
League of Sanctuary, thinking that even so
merciless a soldier as Duke William would respect
its hallowed precincts. But he, godly in a
sense, and superstitious as he was, entertained no
such scruples, and he had no sooner seen his
army encamped than he despatched Thurstinus,
one of the captains, with a body of Norman
soldiers to ravage and plunder the town.</p>

<p>The people of Beverley and the fugitives who
had fled thither deemed themselves safe under
the protection of their patron saint; nevertheless
they felt some alarm when the news was brought
that the ruthless Conqueror lay so near them,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
and still more when they heard that a detachment
was marching upon the town with hostile
intentions. The church was filled with devotees,
who prostrated themselves before the saint's
shrine, imploring him not to abandon his church
and town in this extremity. The day had been
gloomy and downcast, but when they were thus
supplicating the holy saint the sun came shining
through one of the windows directly upon the
shrine, and lighted it up with a brilliance that
seemed supernatural, which was looked upon as a
favourable response to the prayers of the supplicants.</p>

<p>Thurstinus and his followers had by this time
entered the town, but had, so far, done no injury
to either person or property. As they
approached the church, they perceived before
them a venerable figure, clad in canonical
raiment, with gold bracelets on his arms, moving
across the churchyard, towards the western porch.
The sight of the golden bracelets excited the
cupidity of one of the subalterns of the corps,
who darted after him, sword in hand, and overtook
him just as he was passing through the
portal. The soldier had but placed his foot
within the church, when the aged man turned<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
towards him and exclaimed, "Vain and presumptuous
man! darest thou enter my church, the
sacred temple of Christ, sword in hand, with
bloodthirsty intent? This shall be the last time
that thine hand shall draw the sword," and
instantly the sword fell from his grasp, and he
sank down on the ground, stricken by a deadly
paralysis. Thurstinus, not witting what had
happened to his officer, came riding up, with
drawn sword, with the intent of passing into the
church to despoil it of its valuables; but on
entering the doorway he was confronted by the
aged man with the bracelets, who stretched forth
his arm, and said to him, "No further, sacrilegious
man; wouldst thou desolate my church?
Know that it is guarded by superhuman power,
and thou must pay the penalty of thy impious
temerity!" and immediately he fell from his
horse to the pavement with a broken neck, his
face turned backward, and his feet and hands
distorted "like a misshapen monster." At this
manifest interposition of Heaven the Normans
fled back to the encampment with terror-stricken
countenances, and the people in the church
looked round for their deliverer, but he had
vanished, and they then knew that it was St.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
John himself, who had come down from heaven
to protect his town and church from the insult
and ravages of Norman ferocity.</p>

<p>When the soldiers reached the camp they
reported to their superior officer the result of
their expedition and the horrible death of their
leader, which they could not attribute to anything
less than supernatural power. The report in due
course reached the King, who summoned the
soldiers into his presence, and listened to their
narrative with superstitious awe. "Truly," said
he, "this John must be a potent saint, and it were
well not to meddle with what appertains to him,
lest worse evil befal us. He may possibly use his
influence in thwarting our designs against the
rebels of this barbarous northern region. Let not
his town and the lands pertaining to his church be
injured, or subject to the chastisement and just
vengeance we intend against those who have
dared to raise the standard of revolt against our
divinely ordained authority; but rather let them
be protected, for it were bootless and perilous to
fight against Heaven. Onward then to York,
and when we have, by such severity as the case
warrants, effectually crushed the spirit of revolt,
we will consider what further can be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
done to propitiate this saint, whom it were well to
conciliate by gifts, so that he may be led in
gratitude to recompense us by assisting in the
consolidation of our power, which is not yet
established on sufficiently firm foundations."</p>

<p>He found no difficulty in suppressing the
insurrection when he reached York, putting to
the sword those of the insurgents who remained
there after their leaders had fled towards Scotland.
In order to prevent any future rising, with any
possible chance of success or gleam of hope, he
then meditated and carried out a cold-blooded
scheme, which might have been deemed a measure
of policy, but which for ferocity equalled any act
of cruelty perpetrated by the most atrocious
tyrant of pagan ages. He sent forth his men
with swords and torches, to the north, the west,
and the east, and for an extent of sixty miles,
from York to Durham, by several miles in
breadth, laid the country desolate. Villages,
churches, monasteries, and castles, with the
granaries of corn and the standing crops, were all
destroyed by fire, and every person, man, woman,
child, or priest, met with was slaughtered
without mercy; and when the work had been
accomplished, this vast extent of country bore<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
the aspect of a Western American prairie after it
had been swept by fire, leaving only the charred
stumps of the trees standing, with this difference,
however, that there only the half-burnt bodies of
animals, such as were not able to escape by
flight, are found; whilst here, scattered profusely
on the wood-side, and round their once cheerful
and happy homesteads, lay the rotting and
putrefying corpses of human beings, on which the
wolves and birds of prey were battening and
gorging themselves; and it took many and
many a year before this region recovered itself
and became again a country of farmsteads and
villages, of crops and fruit trees, and of an
industrious population. William of Malmesbury
says that not less than 100,000 persons
perished in this fearful act of vengeance;
and Alured of Beverley, a monkish writer, and
treasurer of St. John's Church, states that "The
Conqueror destroyed men, women, and children,
from York even to the western sea, except those
who fled to the church of the glorious confessor,
the most blessed John, Archbishop, at Beverley,
as the only asylum." An indisputable proof of
the desolation wrought on the lands appears in
the Domesday Book, which in most places in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
Yorkshire is described as waste or partially waste,
and which is represented as of no value or of
much less value than in King Edward's time;
whilst in Beverley and the lands of St. John
there is scarcely any waste mentioned, and the
value is given as the same or nearly the same as
in the reign of the Confessor. Under Bevreli we
read, "Value in King Edward's time, to the
Archbishop 24 pounds, to the Canons 20 pounds,
the same as at present."</p>

<p>The King not only exempted the town and
demesne from devastation, but became a notable
benefactor thereto. He added to the possession
of the church certain lands at Sigglesthorne, and
granted the following confirmatory charter:&mdash;"William
the King greets friendly all my Thanes
in Yorkshire, French and English. Know ye
that I have given St. John at Beverley sac and
soc over all the lands which were given in King
Edward's days to St. John's Minster, and also
over the lands which Ealdred, the Archbishop,
hath since obtained in my days, whether in this
Thorp or in Campland. It shall all be free from
me and all other men, excepting the Bishop and
the Minster priests; and no man shall slay deer,
nor violate what I have given to Christ and St.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
John. And I will that there shall be, for ever,
monastic life and canonical congregation so long
as any man liveth. God's blessing be with all
Christian men who assist at this holy worship.
Amen."</p>

<p>And from this time the town flourished greatly,
and grew rapidly in population and wealth. As
to the church, it became more than ever the
resort of pilgrims, who left rich presents on the
shrine of St. John. In the year 1188 the old
Saxon church was destroyed by fire, which may
be deemed a fortunate occurrence, as men were
stimulated at this, the best period of Gothic
architecture, to erect over the relics of St. John a
structure worthy of his eminence and fame; and
the outcome of this impulse was the uprising of
the existing magnificent church, which is now the
great architectural glory of the East Riding.</p>

Beverley Minster may be seen an
uninscribed canopied altar tomb. It
is a very fine specimen of the Early Decorated
style, manifestly dating from the period of
Edward II. or the earlier portion of the reign of
his successor. It is covered with a massive slab
of Purbeck marble, rising above which is an
exquisitely proportioned pointed arch or canopy,
with pinnacles and turrets, crocketted work and
finials, all elaborately chiselled and carefully
finished. History records not whose mortal
remains are deposited in the tomb: there it
stands like the Sphynx on the sands of Egypt,
maintaining a mysterious silence as to its origin,
"a thing of beauty," displaying its elegance of
form and the charms of its sculptured features
to all beholders; but seeming to say&mdash;"Admire
the perfection of my symmetry if you will, but
inquire not whose relics I enshrine, whether of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
noble or saint. Unlike my more gorgeous sister
tomb, in the choir, near the altar, which blazons
forth the glory of the Percys, I choose, with
Christian humility, and recognising the fact that
death renders all equal, and that in the sight of
the Almighty Judge a Percy is no better for all
his glories than the pauper&mdash;to draw a veil over
the earthly greatness of the family to which I
belong."</p>

<p>Although history is thus silent in respect to
the origin of the tomb, tradition is less reticent,
and from its oral records we learn, not perhaps all
that can be desired, but a narrative that probably
has a basis of truth.</p>

<p>About a mile westward of Beverley Westwood,
on the road to York, lies the pretty picturesque
village of Bishop Burton, with its church on an
eminence commanding an extensive view of the
Wold lands on one hand, and of the country sloping
down to the Humber on the other. It is environed
by groups of patriarchal trees, including a
noble specimen of the witch elm on the village
green, with a trunk forty-eight feet in circumference,
and which is held in great veneration by
the villagers; and in the valley below is a small
lake, which doubtless supplied fish to the household<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
of the Archbishops of York when they had
a palace here. It is a very ancient village, dating
from the Celtic period, when it formed a
burial place of the Druids and British chieftains.
One of the numerous tumuli was opened in 1826.
It was seventy yards in circumference, and was
found to contain several skeletons of our remote
forefathers of that race. From some tesselated
pavements which have been discovered, it appears
also to have been occupied afterwards by the
Romans.</p>

<p>At the end of the seventh and beginning of
the eighth century, the Lordship of South
Burton, as it was then called, was held by Earl
Puch, a Saxon noble. Its name was changed,
after the Conquest, to Bishop Burton, from the
circumstance that it belonged to the Archbishops
of York, and their having a palace in the village,
where Archbishop John le Romayne died in
1295. At this time South Burton formed a sort
of oasis in a vast wilderness of forest, extending
for miles in every direction, including the now
open breezy upland of Beverley Westwood, then
infested by wolves, through which ran trackways
to Beverlega, where stood the recently founded
church and monastery of St. John, northward of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
which, at the foot of the Wolds, lay another
extent of forest land, called Northwood,
perpetuated to this day in the name of the street&mdash;Norwood.
Earl Puch's mansion was an
erection of timber, with few of the appliances of
modern domestic life, with a large hall, wherein
he dined with his family and guests at the upper
end of a long table, and his retainers and
domestics at the lower end. More in the interior
were the Lady Puch's bower and other private
and sleeping apartments of the family; with
inferior rooms for the household servants, the
swineherds, cowherds, huntsmen, and other outdoor
menials sleeping in the outhouses, with the
animals of which they had charge.</p>

<p>Earl Puch had built a church in the village, a
very primitive specimen of architecture, consisting
of nave and chancel, of timber and wattles,
with round-headed doors and windows, and rude
zigzag ornamentation. It had neither tower nor
transept, lacked bells, and its pulpit, altar, and
font were fashioned of rough-hewn wood. Yet
was it sufficient for the wants of the age, and
served the purpose of worship, the heart being
rightly tuned, as the most gorgeous cathedral of
after ages.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span></p>

<p>St. John had now resigned the Archbishopric
of York, and had retired to his monastery at
Beverlega, to spend the remnant of his life in
prayer, devotional exercises, and the seclusion of
the cloister. The Earl, a pious man, was on very
friendly terms with the ex-Archbishop, and
invited him to come and consecrate his church,
just finished, to which John readily assented, and,
despite his years and infirmities, on the appointed
day took up his walking staff and went on foot
through Westwood to South Burton, meditating
by the way on his past life, on his ancestral home
at Harpham-on-the-Wolds, his student's life
under St. Hilda at the Abbey of Streoneshalh,
his episcopal career at Hagulstadt, his
experience on the Archiepiscopal Throne of
York, and his retirement to the Abbey of Beverlega,
acknowledging, with grateful thanksgiving,
the Providential hand that had sustained him
through his varied course of life. On the arrival
of the ex-Prelate at South Burton, he found the
family in great grief in consequence of the illness
of the Lady Puch, who had been stricken down
by a severe attack of fever, which threatened to
terminate her life. She was an exceedingly
devout woman, assiduous in her attention to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
duties of religion, charitable to the poor, and a
great blessing to the poor and destitute of the
village. A great portion of her time was spent in
the educational training of her two lovely
daughters, now approaching womanhood, and who
much resembled her in the piety of their lives.
She had now lain in bed a month, suffering agonies
of torment, and expecting every day would be her
last. Her husband wished to postpone the consecration
of the church in consequence of her
critical condition, but she would not listen to it.
"Why," said she, "should the poor people be
deprived of the privilege of hearing the service of
God performed in a consecrated edifice because I,
a poor insignificant mortal like themselves, am
labouring under this affliction? Let the consecration
take place the same as if I were well
and able to take part in the ceremony; the
thought of what is taking place will be more
beneficial to me than all the doctor's medicine
that shall be given me;" and it was determined
that the ceremony should be proceeded with as
if there were no impediment in the way.</p>

<p>Brithunus, a disciple of St. John, and the first
abbot of his monastery, had also come over to
assist in the ceremony, and to him we are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
indebted for a narrative of the miracle which
accompanied it, as well as of many another
notable miracle performed by St. John, which he
communicated to Bede, who interwove them into
his Ecclesiastical History. The consecration was
duly performed according to the Anglo-Saxon
style, with singing, prayers, the sprinkling of
holy water, and a proclamation from the Archbishop
that the edifice was now rendered sacred,
and become a temple of the Living God,
concluding with a benediction. "Then," says
Brithunus, "the Earl desired him to dine at his
house, but the Bishop declined, saying he must
return to the monastery. The Earl pressing him
more earnestly, vowed he would give alms to the
poor if the Bishop would break his fast that day
in his house. I joined my entreaties to his,
promising in like manner to give alms for the
relief of the poor if he would go and dine at the
Earl's house and give his blessing. Having at
length, with great difficulty, prevailed, we went
in to dine."</p>

<p>The banquet was served with the profusion
and splendour of the time, consisting chiefly
of boar's flesh, venison, fish, and birds, eaten from
platters of wood, with an ample supply of wine,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
which was passed round in flagons of silver.
In the course of the repast, the conversation was
confined almost exclusively to two topics&mdash;the new
church and the hopes that were entertained of
its becoming a blessing to the neighbourhood,
and the illness of the Earl's wife, with which the
Bishop sympathised with much kindly feeling.</p>

<p>"Can nothing be done," inquired the Earl,
"by means of the church to alleviate her sufferings,
if not to restore her to health? The
physicians are at their wit's end; they know
nothing of the nature of the disease, and the
remedies they give seem rather to aggravate
than cure it. Peradventure the blessing of a
holy man might have a beneficial effect."</p>

<p>"The issues of life and death," replied the
Bishop, "are in the hands of God alone. Sometimes
it is even impious to attempt to overrule
His ordinations, which, although often inscrutable
and productive of affliction and suffering, are
intended for some ultimate good."</p>

<p>At this moment one of the lady's handmaidens
entered the banqueting-room with a message
from her mistress to the effect that her pains had
materially lessened since the consecration had
taken place, and that she desired a draught of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
holy water that had been used, feeling an
inward conviction that it, accompanied by the
Bishop's blessing, would be of great service.
"The Bishop then," continues Brithunus, "sent
to the woman that lay sick some of the holy
water which he had blessed for the consecration
of the church, by one of the brothers that went
along with me, ordering him to give her some to
drink, and wash the place where her greatest pain
was with some of the same. This being done,
the woman immediately got up in health,
and perceiving that she had not only been delivered
from her tedious distemper, but at the
same time recovered the strength which she had
lost, she presented the cup to the Bishop and me,
and continued serving us with drink, as she had
begun, till dinner was over, following the example
of Peter's mother-in-law, who, having been sick
of a fever, arose at the touch of our Lord, and
having at once received health and strength,
ministered to them."</p>

<p>The two young daughters of the Earl, on witnessing
the miraculous restoration to health of
their beloved mother, had retired together to
their chamber to offer up their heartfelt thanksgivings
to God for her recovery, and before<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
the Bishop's departure came down to
the banqueting-hall and received his blessing.
They were exceedingly lovely both in form and
feature, and when they entered the hall, with
modest downcast eyes, it seemed to those present
as if two angelic beings from the celestial sphere
had deigned to visit them. "Come hither, my
children," said their mother, "and thank the good
Bishop for interceding with heaven on my behalf,
and who has thus been instrumental in delivering
me from the terrible disease under which I have
been labouring for so long a period." In response,
the young maidens went to the Bishop, and
kneeling at his feet, expressed their gratitude to
him for what he had done, and implored his
blessing. Placing his hands on their heads, he
said, "My dear daughters in Christ, attribute not
to me, a sinful mortal, that which is due alone to
our Merciful Father in Heaven, who has seen fit
first to afflict your mother with grievous trials
for some wise purpose, and then suddenly to
restore her to health, that her soul may be purified
so as to enable her to pass through this lower
world, untainted by the grosser sins, but, like all
fallible mortals, to be still open to lesser temptations,
that in the end she may be rendered meet<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
to enter that higher sphere of existence which is
reserved for those who live holy lives here below.
May God bless you, my dear daughters, tread in
the footsteps of your saintly mother, that you
also may be made meet for the same inheritance
of light." So saying, the Bishop took up his
staff, and bidding farewell to the Earl and his
family, wended his way, accompanied by
Brithunus and the monks, through Westwood to
his home at Beverlega.</p>

<p>From this time the two young ladies continued
to grow in stature and loveliness of person, as
well as in fervent piety and the grace of God.
They had sprung up into young womanhood, and
many were the suitors for their hands who came
fluttering about South Burton, knowing well
that, as the Earl had no son, nor was likely to
have one, they must, if they survived him,
become his co-heiresses. But they refused to
listen to the flatteries and protestations of
everlasting love of these young fellows, not so
much because they saw through the hollowness
and feigned nature of their professions of love,
but because they had determined to live lives of
celibacy, devoted solely to the service of God.
St. John made repeated visits to South Burton,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
and nothing afforded them greater spiritual
comfort and holy pleasure than lengthened
converse with him on the things that pertain to
everlasting life. But a couple of years after the
consecration of the church he passed away to his
rest and reward, "with his memory overshadowed
by the benedictions of mankind," and was buried
in the portico of the church of Beverlega, which
he had founded.</p>

<p>A few years after this the two maidens, with
the full consent of their parents, entered the
convent of St. John, at Beverlega, to spend the
remainder of their lives in the holy seclusion of
the cloister. The Earl was an extensive landed
proprietor, with possessions in and about South
Burton, and others on the banks of the Hull,
near Grovehill, a landing-place of the Romans,
and now a suburb of Beverley, with some
extensive manufacturing works. When his
daughters entered the convent he bestowed upon
it the manor of Walkington, lying southward of
South Burton and abutting on Beverley Westwood.
At the same time he made a grant to the
people of Beverlega of a tract of swampy land on
the banks of the Hull, to serve as a common
pasturage for their cattle. This tract of land,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
now called Swinemoor, is still held by the
burgesses of Beverley, forming one of the four
valuable pastures, containing, in the aggregate,
nearly 1,200 acres, the property of the freemen of
the borough.</p>

<p>There are reasons for believing that a Christian
Church existed on the shores of the Beaver Lake,
in the wood of Deira, the site of the modern
Beverley, in the time of the Ancient British
Apostolic Christianity, which had formerly been
the scene of the Druidical religion, which was
destroyed by the pagan Saxons, and re-edified by
St. John the Archbishop. In one of his
progresses through his diocese, he came to this
clearing in the wood of Deira, with its sacred
beaver-lake, formerly called Llyn yr Avanc, now
Inder-a-wood, and was struck by its sylvan
beauty and its quiet seclusion. He found there
a very small wooden church, thatched with reeds,
which he determined to restore and enlarge, and
founded, in connection with it, a religious house
for both sexes&mdash;a monastery for men and a
nunnery for women. He added to it a choir, and
appointed seven priests to officiate at the altar;
built the monastery, and endowed it with lands for
its support. Hither he retired when enfeebled by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
age, and here he was buried in the porch of his
church in the year 721.</p>

<p>It was to this nunnery that the Sisters Agnes
and Agatha went, and after a period of
probation, were despoiled of their hair, and
assumed the veil of the sisterhood. The
religious houses of the Saxons were not the
luxurious abodes that they became in after years.
The life led there was one of ascetic severity,
with bare walls, hard pallets, scanty food of the
simplest description, a continuous series of
prayers and religious exercises, accompanied by
frequent fastings, penances, and fleshly mortification,
to all which the two sisters submitted with
cheerfulness, as conducive to the spiritual health
of their souls. They were never found sleeping
when the summons for divine service was sounded
forth, and they were ever willing to perform the
most menial duties as tending to keep within
them a spirit of Christian humility. Their
profound piety and rigorous attention to disciplinary
matters excited the admiration of the
Mother Superior, but never would they lend ear
to praises from her lips, lest it should engender
spiritual pride, the aim of their lives being to
rank as the lowest servants of the servants of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
Christ. And thus the years passed along in one
monotonous but ever-blessed sameness, ever
dwelling within the walls and precincts of the
nunnery, save on two occasions, when they went
to South Burton to attend the funerals of their
parents.</p>

<p>It was the eve of the Nativity, a bright starlight
night, as that over Bethlehem when the three
wise men of the East came thither guided by the
wandering star. The nuns were assembled in
their chapel for an early service, amongst whom
were the two sisters apparently absorbed in
divine meditation. The nuns then retired for
their evening refection and silent contemplation in
their cells until midnight, when the bell
summoned them again to the chapel for midnight
Mass, which was to usher in the holy day. At
this service there was a strange and unwonted
omission; the two sisters were absent. "Where
are the Sisters Agnes and Agatha?" inquired the
Abbess; "surely something has befallen them,
else they would not be absent, especially on such
an occasion as this. Go and search diligently for
them." Every corner of the building and the
grounds outside were searched, but in vain; not
a vestige of them could be found; and at length,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
as the hour of midnight was close at hand, the
Mass was proceeded with. The following day,
that of the Nativity, was devoted to the usual
festal, religious duties; but a heaviness of heart
pervaded the assembly, as the sisters had not
re-appeared, and no tidings of them could be
heard.</p>

<p>Days, weeks, and months passed away, and no
clue to their mysterious disappearance presented
itself until the eve of St. John, their patron saint.
The vespers had been sung, with special reference
to the coming day, and the nuns had gone out to
breathe the air of the summer evening, whilst the
Abbess, taking the key of the tower, unlocked
the door and went up the stone stairs to the top,
a place not much frequented, where she thought
to offer up her prayers beneath the open dome
of heaven, without any intervening walls. She
had just placed her foot on the topmost stair
when she was startled at beholding the two
sisters lying locked in each other's arms and with
upward turned eyes. At the first glance she
supposed them to be dead, but a moment after
was undeceived by their rising, and saying,
"Mother, dear! it will soon be time for the midnight
Mass; but how is this? We lay down an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
hour ago, under the sky of a winter night, but
now we have awakened under the setting sun of
a summer eve."</p>

<p>"An hour ago! my children," replied the
Abbess, "it is now months since you disappeared
on the eve of the Nativity, and months since the
midnight Mass of the birth of our Saviour was
sung. Can it be you have been sleeping here all
through the interval?"</p>

<p>"Mother, dear," they replied, after some
further questionings and explanations, "we have
not been sleeping, we have been transported to
heaven, and have seen sights inconceivable to the
human eye, and heard music such as has never
been listened to in this lower world. The heaven
that we have visited is no mere localised spot, but
extends throughout infinite space. It possesses
no land or water; no mountains and valleys; no
rivers, or lakes, or trees, or material objects of
any kind; but has picturesque scenery, impalpable
and cloudlike, of the most ravishing beauty. It
is peopled by myriads of angelic beings and
beatified mortals, unsubstantial and etherealised,
all of exquisitely symmetrical figures, and with
gloriously radiant features, beaming with happiness
and smiling with serenity. Unlike the popular<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
opinion, it is not a place of idle lounging and
repose, but of intense activity, all being engaged
in employments which afford an intensity of
pleasurable emotions. The Almighty Father and
Creator of all this realm of beauty and of all
these glorified creatures it was not possible for us
to see with our mortal eyes, but we were perfectly
cognisant of His influence and presence everywhere
throughout the infinitude of space. But
oh! the music! here, on earth, it is termed
divine, but our sweetest melodies are but a jarring
discord of sounds compared with that of heaven;
mortal ear cannot form the faintest conception of
its sublime grandeur and unutterable loveliness."</p>

<p>Thus spake they to the astonished Abbess, who
at once recognised the fact of their miraculous
transportation to the realms of light for a
temporary sojourn there, that on their return to
earth they might be the means of comforting and
encouraging those who by holy lives of asceticism,
self-denial, and prayer, were wending their way
thitherwards; and she conducted them down to
their sister nuns, to whom again they had to
narrate the visions that had been vouchsafed to
them.</p>

<p>The Sisters further stated that the first spirit
they met was the holy St. John, the founder of
their convent, whom they immediately recognised,
although he had cast off his earthly integuments,
and appeared in a glorified form, but in semblance
as when he performed the miracle at South
Burton.</p>

<p>He welcomed them with affectionate warmth,
and told them that their parents were now
enjoying the reward of their virtuous and
pious lives, but that they could not be permitted
to see them until they themselves had finally
passed away from earthly life. He further told
them that he kept a watchful eye over his town
and monastery in Inder-a-wood, with affectionate
love, which should be seen in after ages, in the
promotion of their prosperity.</p>

<p>The next day the festival of St. John was
celebrated in the monastery and church, with
more than usual interest and devotion. Towards
the close of it&mdash;</p>

<p>At the same time the church became lighted up
with a supernatural roseate hue, and sounds of
celestial music ravished the ears of the assembly.
The Sisters were laid side by side by tender and
reverent hands in a tomb near the altar of the
church, and now&mdash;</p>

were wont to commence their
tales of love, chivalry, and romance&mdash;there
dwelt in the most wild and rugged part of
Wharncliffe Chase, near Rotherham, a fearful
dragon, with iron teeth and claws. How he
came there no one knew, or where he came from;
but he proved to be a most pestilent neighbour to
the villagers of Wortley&mdash;blighting the crops by
the poisonous stench of his breath, devouring the
cattle of the fields, making no scruple of seizing
upon a plump child or a tender young virgin to
serve as a <i>bonne-bouche</i> for his breakfast table,
and even crunching up houses and churches to
satisfy his ravenous appetite.</p>

Penistone, and belongs now, as it has done
for centuries, to the Wortley family. Before
the dissolution of monasteries, the Rectory
of Penistone belonged to the Abbey of St.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
Stephen, Westminster, and was granted, when
the Abbey was dissolved, to Thomas Howard,
third Duke of Norfolk, who out of the proceeds
established in Sheffield a set of almshouses. The
impropriation of the great tithes were let to the
Wortley family, who, by measures of oppression
and extortion, contrived to get a great deal more
than they were entitled to, and Nicholas Wortley
insisted on taking the tithes in kind, but was
opposed by Francis Bosville, who obtained a
decree (17th Elizabeth) against him; but Sir
Francis Wortley, in the succeeding reign, again
attempted to enforce payment in kind,
with so much disregard to the suffering
he inflicted upon the poor that they determined
upon finding out some champion who
would dare to attack this redoubtable dragon in
his den at Wantley, so as to put an end, once and
for all, to the destruction of their crops, the loss
of their cattle, and the desolation of their ruined
homes. Foremost in this movement was one
Lyonel Rowlestone, who married the widow of
Francis Bosville; and the parishioners entered into
an agreement to unite in opposition to the claims
of the Wortleys. The parchment on which it is
written is dated 1st James I., and bristles with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
the names and seals of the people of Penistone of
that time, and is still extant.</p>

<p>In the neighbourhood, on a moor not far from
Bradfield, stood a mansion called More or Moor
Hall, and was inhabited by a family who had
resided there from the time of Henry II., but of
whom little is known, excepting the wonderful
achievement of one member of the family,
"More of More Hall," who slew the Dragon of
Wantley.</p>

<p>The family had for their crest a green
dragon, and there was formerly in Bradfield
Church a stone dragon, five feet in length, which
had some connection with the family. To this
worthy, who, it is supposed, may have been an
attorney or counsellor, the parishioners of Penistone,
having decided upon appealing to the law
courts, applied to undertake their case, and make
battle on the terrible dragon in his den among
the rocks of the forest of Wharncliffe. He
readily complied with their wish, and with great
boldness and valour prepared for the conflict by
going to Sheffield and ordering a suit of armour,
studded with spikes&mdash;that is, arming himself with
the panoply of law, and then went forth and
made the attack. The fight is said, in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
ballad narrative, to have lasted two days and
nights, probably the duration of the lawsuit, and
in the end he killed the dragon, or won his suit,
thus relieving the people of Penistone from any
further annoyance or unjust exaction from that
quarter. Sir Francis Wortley persuaded his
cousin Wordsworth, the freehold lord of the
manor (ancestor, lineal or collateral, of the Poet
Wordsworth), to stand aloof in the matter,
and now the Wortley and the Wordsworth
are the only estates in the parish that pay
tithes.</p>

<p>To commemorate the event an exceedingly
humorous and cleverly satirical ballad was written,
which, being also a lively burlesque on the ballad
romances of chivalry, served the same purpose
towards them that Cervantes' "Don Quixote"
did for the prose fictions of the same character.
Thus opens the ballad&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

<p>It then goes on to describe how "he ate three
children at one sup, as one would eat an apple."
Also all sorts of cattle and trees, the forest
beginning to diminish very perceptibly, and
"houses and churches," which to him were geese
and turkeys, "leaving none behind."</p>

<p>These stones are supposed to be a reference to
the Lyonel Rowlestone, who was the leader of the
opposition. There are many local allusions of a
similar character, which would no doubt add
much to the keenness of the satire and the
humour, but which are lost to us through our
ignorance of the circumstances and persons
alluded to.</p>

<p>"In Yorkshire, near fair Rotherham," was his

drank.</p>

<p>"Hard by a furious knight there dwelt," who
could "wrestle, play at quarter-staff, kick, cuff,

a horse till he was dead, and eat him all up but
his head." To this wonderful athlete came
"men, women, girls, and boys, sighing and
sobbing, and made a hideous noise&mdash;O! save us
all, More of More Hall, thou peerless knight of

The Knight replied&mdash;</p>

</div></div>

<p>This being agreed to, he hied to Sheffield, and
had a suit of armour, covered with spikes five or
six inches long, made, which, when he donned it,
caused the people to take him for "an Egyptian
porcupig," and the cattle for "some strange,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>

<p>Thus equipped and with his valour braced up,
he went to Wantley, concealing himself in the
well, and when the dragon came to drink, he
shouted "Boh," and struck the monster a blow
on the mouth. The knight then came out of the
well, and they commenced fighting, for some time
without advantage on either side&mdash;without either
receiving a wound. At length, however, after
fighting two days and a night, the dragon gave
him a blow which made him reel and the earth to
quake. "But More of More Hall, like a valiant
son of Mars," returned the compliment with such
vigour that&mdash;</p>

<p>Henry Carey, in 1738, brought out an opera on
the subject, entitled "The Dragon of Wantley,"
abounding in humour, and a fine burlesque on the
Italian operas of the period, then the rage of
fashion. And in 1873, Poynter exhibited at the
Royal Academy a picture of "More of More
Hall and the Dragon."</p>

by patriarchal trees of luxuriant
foliage, between the towns of Driffield
and Beverley, nestles a Tudoresque building,
which goes by the name of Watton Abbey,
although it never was an abbey, but a Gilbertine
Priory. It is now a private residence, and was
occupied for many years as a school, the existing
buildings apparently having been erected since
the dissolution, and there are but few remains of
the original convent, saving a portion of the
nunnery, now converted into stables, a hollow
square indicating the site of the kitchen and the
moat which originally surrounded the entire
enclosure. A couple of centuries ago there were
extensive remains of the old priory, but they
were removed for the purpose of repairing
Beverley Minster. Moreover, the abbey has a
haunted room, which, however, has no connection
with the monastic times, although the ghost that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
haunts it is usually designated "The Headless
Nun of Watton," but belongs to the civil war
period of the seventeenth century. The fact is
that story tellers of the legend confound two
altogether different narratives&mdash;the one of a
trangressing nun of the twelfth century, and the
other of a murdered lady of the seventeenth,
combining their two histories into one story, as if
their persons were identical.</p>

<p>A nunnery was established here in a very
early period of Anglo-Saxon Christianity, probably
soon after its re-introduction into Northumbria
by King Oswald, as we find St. John
of Beverley performing a miracle there, which
would be about the year 720, after he had
resigned his Bishopric and retired to Beverley.
It appears that he was an intimate friend of the
Lady Prioress&mdash;Heribury&mdash;and made frequent
visits to Watton to administer spiritual advice
and ghostly consolation to the inmates under her
charge. On one occasion when he went thither,
he found the Prioress's daughter suffering great
agony from a diseased and swollen arm, the
result of unskilful bleeding, and was solicited to
go to her chamber and give her his blessing,
which might be the means of alleviating the pain.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
He inquired when she had been bled, and was
told on the fourth day of the moon, which he
said was a very inauspicious day, quoting Archbishop
Theodore as his authority, and he feared
his prayers would be of no avail. Nevertheless
he went to her room, prayed for her restoration
to health, gave her his blessing, and went down
to dinner. They had, however, scarcely
seated themselves when a servant came in,
stating that all her pain had gone, her swollen
arm had been reduced to its natural size, and that
she was perfectly restored to health, and was
dressing to come down and dine with them.</p>

<p>The nunnery was destroyed, it is presumed, by
the Danes at the same time that the Monastery
of Beverley perished at their hands, in the ninth
century, and it lay waste and desolate until the
twelfth century, although we find from the
Domesday survey that there were then a church
and priest in the village.</p>

<p>In 1148-9, Eustace Fitz John, Lord of
Knaresborough, and a favourite of King
Henry I., at the instance of Murdac, Archbishop
of York, refounded the convent, in atonement for
certain crimes he had committed. It was
established for thirteen canons and thirty-six<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
nuns of the new Gilbertine order, who were to
live in the same block of buildings, but with a
party wall for the separation of the sexes; the
canons "to serve the nuns perpetually in terrene
as well as in divine matters." He endowed it
with the Lordship of Watton, with all its appurtenances
in pure and perpetual alms for the
salvation of his soul, and those of his wife, his
father and mother, brothers and sisters, friends
and servants.</p>

<p>Archbishop Murdac was at the time resident
at Beverley, the gates of York having been
shut against him; and it may be that the fact of
his predecessor, St. John, the patron-saint of the
town where he dwelt, having performed a great
miracle there, was what influenced him in his
desire to see a resuscitation of the monastery.
He was a remarkable man, and had led a somewhat
adventurous life. Archbishop Thurstan
was his patron, and gave him some preferments
in the church of York, which he resigned at the
pressing invitation of St. Bernard, founder of the
Cistercians, to become a monk at Clervaux.
Soon after he was sent by his superior to found a
Cistercian house at Vauclair, of which he was
appointed the first abbot, in 1131, where he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
remained until 1143, when, at the recommendation
of St. Bernard, he was elected Abbot
of Fountains. Under his judicious and able
government the abbey prospered and threw off
not less than seven offshoots&mdash;those of Kirkstall,
Lix, Meaux, Vaudy, and Woburn.</p>

<p>On the death of Archbishop Thurstan, King
Stephen desired the canons to elect William
Fitzherbert, his nephew and their treasurer, in
his place, which they were willing to do, but the
Cistercians, headed by Murdac, suspecting that
undue influence had been made use of, vehemently
opposed his election, and Pope Eugenius, on the
appeal of St. Bernard, suspended Fitzherbert.</p>

<p>Fitzherbert, out of revenge, went with his
friends to Fountains, broke open the door,
searched ineffectually for Murdac, then fired the
abbey, and retired. This act caused a great
sensation, and the Archbishop was deprived in
1147. The same year an assembly met at
Richmond, and elected Murdac as Archbishop,
who immediately went to Rome and obtained his
pall from Pope Eugenius; but on his return
found York barred against his entrance, upon
which he retired to Beverley. Stephen, the
King, refused to recognise him, sequestering the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
stalls of York, and fining the town of Beverley for
harbouring him. It was at this time that he
promoted the re-establishment of Watton, and
placed within its walls a child of four years of
age to be educated, with a view of taking the
veil.</p>

<p>In retaliation, he excommunicated Puisnet,
Treasurer of York, and laid the city under an
interdict. Puisnet was afterwards elected Bishop
of Durham, upon which Murdac excommunicated
the Prior and Archdeacon, who came to Beverley
to implore pardon, and could only obtain
absolution on acknowledging their fault and
submitting to scourging at the entrance to
Beverley Minster. He died at Beverley in the
same year (1153), and was buried in York
Cathedral.</p>

<p>Elfleda, the child whom Murdac had placed in
the convent, was a merry, vivacious little
creature; and whilst but a child was a source of
amusement to the sisterhood, who, although
prim and demure in bearing, and some of them
sour-tempered and acid in their tempers, were
wont to smile at her youthful frolics and ringing
laugh; but as she grew older, her outbursts
of merriment, and the sallies of wit that began to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
animate her conversation, were checked, as being
inconsistent with the character of a young lady
who was now enrolled as novice, preparatory to
taking the veil. As she advanced towards
womanhood her form gradually developed into a
most symmetrical figure; and her features
became the perfection of beauty, set off with a
transparent delicacy of complexion, such as would
have rendered her a centre of attraction even
among the beauties of a Royal Court. This
excited the jealousy of the sisters, who were
chiefly elderly and middle-aged spinsters, whose
homely and somewhat coarse features had proved
detrimental to their hopes of obtaining husbands.
They began to treat her with scornful looks,
chilling neglect, and petty persecutions; but
when she, later on, evinced a manifest repugnance
to convent life, ridiculed the ways of the holy
sisters, and even satirised them, they charged her
with entertaining rebellious and ungodly sentiments,
and subjected her to penances and other
modes of wholesome correction, such as they
considered would subdue her worldly spirit.</p>

<p>Sprightly and light-hearted as she was, Elfleda
was not happy, immured as she was within these
detested walls, and condemned to assist in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
wearisome services, such as she thought might
perhaps be congenial to the souls of her elder
sisters, whose hopes of worldly happiness and
conjugal endearment had been blighted, but
which were altogether unsuited for one so
beautiful (for she knew that she was fair, and was
vain of her looks) and so cheerful-minded as
herself; and she longed with intense desire to
make her escape, mingle with the outer world,
and have free intercourse with the other sex.</p>

<p>According to the charter of endowment, the
lay brethren of the monastery were entrusted
with the management of the secular affairs of the
nunnery, which necessitated their admission
within its portals on certain occasions for conference
with the prioress. On these occasions
Elfleda would cast furtive and very un-nunlike
glances upon their persons. She was particularly
attracted by one of them, a young man of
prepossessing mien and seductive style of speech,
and she felt her heart beat wildly whenever he
came with the other visitors. He noticed her
surreptitious glances, and saw that she was
exceedingly beautiful, and his heart responded
to the sentiment he felt that he had inspired in
hers. They maintained this silent but eloquent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
language of love for some time, and soon found
means of having stolen interviews under the
darkness of night, when vows of everlasting love
were interchanged, and led, eventually, to
consequences which at the outset were not
dreamt of by the erring pair.</p>

<p>Suspicion having been excited by her altered
form, she was summoned before her superiors on
a charge of "transgressing the conventual rules
and violating one of the most stringent laws of
monastic life," and as concealment was impossible,
she boldly confessed her fault, adding that she
had no vocation for a convent life, and desired to
be banished from the community. This request
could not be listened to for a moment. The
culprit had brought a scandal and indelible stain
upon the fair fame of the house, which must, at
any cost, be concealed from the world; and her
open avowal of her guilt raised in the breasts of
the pious sisterhood a perfect fury of indignation,
and a determination to inflict immediate and
condign punishment on her. It was variously
suggested that she should be burnt to death, that
she should be walled up alive, that she should be
flayed, that her flesh should be torn from her
bones with red-hot pincers, that she should be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
roasted to death before a fire, etc.; but the more
prudent and aged averted these extreme
measures, and suggested some milder forms of
punishment, which were at once carried out.
The miserable object of their vengeance was
stripped of her clothing, stretched on the floor,
and scourged with rods until the blood trickled
down profusely from her lacerated back. She
was then cast into a noisome dungeon, without
light, fettered by iron chains to the floor, and
supplied with only bread and water, "which was
administered with bitter taunts and reproaches."</p>

<p>Meanwhile the young man, her paramour, had
left the monastery, and as the nuns were desirous
of inflicting some terrible punishment upon him
for his horrible crime, they extorted from Elfleda,
under promise that she should be released and
given up to him, the confession that he was still
in the neighbourhood in disguise, and that not
knowing of the discovery that had been made, he
would come to visit her, and make the usual
signal of throwing a stone on the roof over her
sleeping cell. The Prioress made this known to
the brethren of the monastery, and arranged with
them for his capture. The following night he
came, looked cautiously round, and then threw<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
the stone, when the monks rushed out of ambush,
cudgelled him soundly, and then took him a
prisoner into the house. "The younger
part of the nuns, inflamed with a pious zeal,
demanded the custody of the prisoner, on
pretence of gaining further information. Their
request was granted, and taking him to an unfrequented
part of the convent, they committed on
his person such brutal atrocities as cannot be
translated without polluting the page on which
they are written; and, to increase the horror, the
lady was brought forth to be witness of the
abominable scene." Whilst lying in her dungeon,
Elfleda became penitent, and conscious of having
committed a gross crime, and one night whilst
sleeping in her fetters, Archbishop Murdac
appeared to her and charged her with having
cursed him. She replied that she certainly had
cursed him for having placed her in so uncongenial
a sphere. "Rather curse yourself," said
he, "for having given way to temptation." "So
I do," she answered, "and I regret having imputed
the blame to you." He then exhorted her
to repentance and the daily repetition of certain
psalms, and then vanished,&mdash;a vision which
afforded her much consolation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span></p>

<p>The holy sisters were now much troubled on the
question of what should be done with the infant
which was expected daily, and preparations were
made for its reception; when Elfleda was again
visited by the Archbishop, accompanied by two
women who, "with the holy aid of the Archbishop,
safely delivered her of the infant, which they bore
away in their arms, covered with a fair linen
cloth." When the nuns came the next morning
they found her in perfect health and restored to
her youthful appearance, without any signs of
the accouchement, and charged her with
murdering the infant,&mdash;a very improbable idea,
seeing that she was still chained to the floor.
She narrated what had occurred, but was not
believed. The next night all her fetters were
miraculously removed, and when her cell was
entered the following morning she was found
standing free, and the chains not to be
found.</p>

<p>The Father Superior of the convent was then
called in, and he invited Alured, Abbot of
Rievaulx, to assist him in the investigation of the
case, who decided that it was a miraculous
intervention, and the Abbot departed, saying,
"What God hath cleansed call not thou common<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
or unclean, and whom He hath loosed thou
mayest not bind."</p>

<p>What afterwards became of Elfleda is not
stated, but we may presume that after these
miraculous events she would be admitted as a
thrice holy member of the sisterhood, despite her
little peccadillo.</p>

<p>Alured of Rievaulx, the monkish chronicler,
narrates the substance of the above circumstances,
and vouches for their truth. "Let no one,"
says he, "doubt the truth of this account, for I
was an eye-witness to many of the facts, and the
remainder were related to me by persons of such
mature age and distinguished piety, that I cannot
doubt the accuracy of the statement."</p>

<p>This is the story of the frail and unfortunate
nun; the other, which is usually dovetailed on
the former, is of much more recent date. In the
present house there is a chamber wainscoted
throughout with panelled oak, one of the panels
forming a door, so accurately fitted that it cannot
be distinguished from the other panels. It is
opened by a secret spring, and communicates
with a stone stair that goes down to the moat;
it may be that the room was a hiding-place
for the Jesuits or priests of the Catholic Church<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
when they were so ruthlessly hunted down and
barbarously executed in the Elizabethan and
Jacobean reigns. The room is reputed to be
haunted by the ghost of a headless lady with an
infant in her arms, who comes, or came
thither formerly, to sleep nightly, the bed-clothes
being found the following morning in a disordered
state, as they would be after a person had been
sleeping in them. If by chance any person had
daring enough to occupy the room, the ghost
would come, minus the head, dressed in blood-stained
garments, with her infant in her arms,
and would stand motionless at the foot of the bed
for a while, and then vanish. A visitor on one
occasion, who knew nothing of the legend, was
put to sleep in the chamber, who in the morning
stated that his slumbers had been disturbed by a
spectral visitant, in the form of a lady with
bloody raiment and an infant, and that her
features bore a strange resemblance to those of a
lady whose portrait hung in the room; from
which it would appear that on that special
occasion she had donned her head.</p>

<p>According to the legend, a lady of distinction
who then occupied the house was a devoted
Royalist in the great civil war which resulted in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
the death of King Charles. It was after the
battle of Marston Moor, which was a death-blow
to the Royalists north of the Humber, and when
the Parliamentarians dominated the broad lands
of Yorkshire, that a party of fanatical Roundheads
came into the neighbourhood of Watton,
"breathing out threatenings and slaughter"
against the "malignants," and especially against
such as still clung to the "vile rags of the whore
of Babylon," vowing to put all such to the sword.
The Lady of Watton, who was a devout Catholic,
heard of this band of Puritan soldiers, who were
"rampaging" over the Wolds, and of the
barbarous murders of which they had been guilty.
Her husband was away fighting in the ranks of
the King down Oxford way, and she was left
without any protector excepting a handful of
servants, male and female, who would be of no
use against a band of armed soldiers, and it was
with great fear and trembling that she heard of
their arrival at Driffield, some three or four miles
distant, where they had been plundering and
maltreating "the Philistines;" fearing more for
her infant than herself, as she believed the
prevalent exaggerated rumour, that it was a
favourite amusement with them to toss babies up<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
in the air and catch them on the points of their
pikes.</p>

<p>At length news was brought that the
marauders were on the march to Watton, for
the purpose of plundering it, as the home of a
malignant, and the lady, for better security, shut
herself, with her child and her jewels, in the
wainscoted room, hoping in case of extremity to
escape by means of a secret stair, and in the
meanwhile committed herself and child to the
care of the Virgin Mother. It was not long ere
the band of soldiers arrived and hammered at the
door, calling aloud for admittance, but met with
no response. They were about breaking down
the door, and went in search of implements for
the purpose, when they caught sight of a low
archway opening upon the moat, which they
guessed to be a side entrance to the house, and
crossing the moat, they found the stair, which
they ascended and came to the panel, which they
concluded was a disguised door. A few blows
sufficed to dash it open, and they came into the
presence of the lady, who was prostrate before a
crucifix. Rising up, she demanded what they
wanted, and wherefore this rude intrusion. They
replied that they had come to despoil the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
"Egyptian" who owned the mansion, and if he
had been present, to smite him to death as a
worshipper of idols and an abomination in the
eyes of God.</p>

<p>An angry altercation ensued, the lady, who
possessed a high spirit, making a free use of her
tongue in upbraidings and reproaches for their
dastardly conduct on the Wolds, of which she had
heard, to which they listened very impatiently,
and replied in coarse language not fit for a lady's
ears, at the same time demanding the plate and
other valuables of the house. She scornfully
refused to give them up, and told them that if
they wanted them they must find them for themselves,
and at length so provoked them by her
taunts that they cried, "Hew down with the
sword the woman of Belial and the spawn of the
malignant," and suiting the action to the word,
they caught her child from her arms, dashed its
brains out against the wall, and then cut her down
and "hewed" off her head, after which they
plundered the house and departed with their
spoil.</p>

<p>It must not be supposed that these ruffians
were a fair specimen of the brave, God-fearing
men who fought under Fairfax, and put Newcastle<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
and Rupert to flight at Marston Moor, who
fought with the sword in one hand and the Bible
in the other, who laid the axe at the root of
Royal abitrary prerogative, and were the real
authors of the civil and religious liberty which we
now enjoy. But, as in all times of civil commotion,
there were evil-minded wretches who,
for purpose of plunder, assumed the garb and
adopted the phraseology of the noble-minded
soldiers of Fairfax and Hampden, and the Ironsides
of Cromwell, out-Puritaned them in their
hypocritical cant, bringing disgrace and scandal
upon the armies with which they associated
themselves. And such were the villains who despoiled
Watton, and slew so barbarously the poor
lady and her infant; and from that time the ghost
of the lady has haunted the room in which the
deed was perpetrated.</p>

<p>In the year 1780, Mr. Bethell, the then
occupier of the house, was giving a dinner-party
in the dining-room, which adjoined the haunted
apartment. When they were seated over their
wine the host related the story of the ghost, and
had scarcely finished it when an unearthly sound
issued from the floor beneath their feet. Consternation
seized on the party. They concluded<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
that it was the ghost, and to their imagination
the candles began to emit a blue, ghostly light.
It seemed to be a confirmation of the truth of the
story; but they summoned up courage enough to
make an examination, and although it was
approaching the "witching hour of night," they
sent for a carpenter, who took up some planks of
the floor, and found&mdash;not the ghost, but the nest
of an otter from the moat, who had made there a
home for her progeny, whose cries had alarmed
them; and thus was dissipated what might otherwise
have been deemed a veritable supernatural
visitation.</p>

</div><p><span class="dropletter">S</span><span class="smcap">ir</span> Richard de Veron was a distinguished
knight of the North Riding,
who held a considerable estate by
knight's service of the De Brus family in Cleveland.
He was one of the heroes of the Battle of
the Standard, in 1138, who went forth at the
behest of Archbishop Thurstan to oppose the
invasion of David of Scotland, and who signally
defeated that monarch. A few years after, he
joined the forces of the Empress Maud, whose pretensions
to the throne of England he considered
to be more legitimate than those of Stephen, and
fought on her side at Lincoln, in 1141, when the
King was defeated and taken prisoner, continuing
to uphold her cause until she was compelled to
retire from England. The war being thus
brought to an end, and the adherents of the
Empress generally declining to take service under
a King whom they deemed a usurper, and by
whom they were looked upon with suspicion, De<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
Veron sheathed his sword and retired to his
family and home in Cleveland. He had a wife,
whom he dearly loved, and two children, a
boy&mdash;his heir, and a sweet little daughter for
whom he entertained the most tender affection;
indeed, although he delighted in the clash of arms
and the exciting revelry of war, he was never so
truly happy as when in the midst of his family,
teaching his young son to ride, practice at the
target, and follow his hounds in pursuit of the wild
animals of the chase; or listening to the prattle
of his little daughter, when taking lessons from
her mother in reading, music, or embroidery
work. Thus happily passed a few months after
his return from his martial pursuits, when one
morning, news was brought that a case of plague
had occurred in the village, causing, as it always
did, great consternation not only amongst the
villagers, but in the knight's mansion, which
stood half a mile away from the village. It was
hoped that it might be an isolated case, and such
rude remedial measures as were then known were
adopted to prevent the spread of the infection,
but within a week another case was reported, and
another and another in rapid succession, after
which it spread with fearful speed, until half the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
population succumbed to it, and were hastily
buried without the usual funeral rites. In a
month the disease appeared to be dying out, the
deaths were fewer and fewer day by day, and it
was fondly hoped that the terrible infliction was
passing away, but it was not until three-fourths
of the people had fallen victims to its pestilential
fury.</p>

<p>Although Sir Richard hesitated not to go
down to the village and employ himself in
administering food, medicine, and consolation to
the afflicted, he took every known precaution
against coming into too close contact with the
infected; he kept his family closely shut up at
home, and occupied a separate set of apartments
himself, not allowing them to come into his
presence; but notwithstanding all his preventive
measures he was at last stricken down. He gave
positive orders that he should be left alone, and
if it was God's will that he should die, he declared
his resolution that he would die alone, and with
affectionate earnestness sent a message to his
wife, entreating her to remain apart from him,
and not imperil her dear life by coming to his
bedside. But she, true wife as she was, heeded
not the risk to her own life, so long as she could<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
afford comfort and spiritual consolation to him,
in what might very probably be his last few
moments on earth, and regardless of the injunction,
hastened, on receiving the message, to the
room where he lay. He reproached her gently
for exposing herself to the risk of infection, but
was met by assurances that it was not possible
for her to remain away whilst he was lying there
requiring careful tendence, with all the servants
standing aloof panic-stricken, or flying from the
house. He implored her to retire, but she
replied that she might or might not take the
infection; that was as God pleased, and if she did
she might or might not fall a victim, but most
assuredly if she left him alone and shut herself
up away from him she would die of
anxiety, or, in case of his death, of a broken
heart. Finding remonstrance useless, he was
fain to submit to her nursing, and happily during
the night the malady passed its crisis, his strong,
healthy constitution enabling him to battle
successfully with the disease, and he gradually
became convalescent.</p>

<p>Happiness again seemed to be dawning over
the household, but it was not destined to last
long. The faithful wife, who had watched so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
tenderly over his sick bed, regardless of the risk
she ran, maintained her health so long as her
services were needed, but in her ministrations she
had imbibed the seed of the fatal malady, and now,
when her husband was restored to health, the
terrible plague spot made its appearance, and so
rapidly did the disease develop itself that, within
twenty-four hours, she fell a victim to its remorseless
energy. It was a fearful blow to Sir
Richard, but this was not all the suffering he had
to undergo. Scarcely had he returned from the
obsequies of his wife, when his two children
caught the infection, and in another four-and-twenty
hours they were both carried off, leaving
him bereft of all the best-beloved of his soul, and
sunk in the depths of desolation and despair.</p>

<p>For some months he remained in his silent and
cheerless home in a state of profound apathy,
taking no interest in the avocations devolving on
him as the lord of an extensive estate. It is
true he befriended, pecuniarily, the numerous
widows and orphans left in the village by the
ruthless pestilence that had swept over it, and he
contributed large sums of money to the Church
for prayers and masses for the souls of the
departed, not only of his own family, but of his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
vassals and dependants. Nothing seemed capable
of rousing him from the despondency into which
he had fallen; the sports of the field were
altogether neglected; the cheerful companionship
of friends presented no attractions for him, and he
sat at home hour after hour through the live-long
day, plunged in moody melancholy and repining
meditation on his irreparable loss, and the utter
extinction of all that was worth living for. And
thus passed week after week and month after
month, Time, the great mollifier of grief, seeming
to impart no balm to his sorrow-stricken soul.</p>

<p>The only person whom he admitted as a visitor,
besides those who came on imperative business
matters, was Father Anselm, a pious and devout
man, the priest of the village church. It was in
his company only, and in listening to his spiritual
converse, that he felt any relief from the grief
that oppressed him, and gradually, after many
interviews, he began to look upon his affliction as
a providential dispensation, intended for some
wise purpose. Gradually also he became more
weaned from earthly and secular things, and his
soul to become more spiritualised, and he began
to experience a feeling of attraction to the cloister.
One day he mentioned this to his spiritual<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
adviser, and Father Anselm, rejoicing thereat,
warmly applauded the feeling, urging that such
self-devotion would be most acceptable to God,
and that it was only in religious meditation and
prayer that he would be vouchsafed that true
consolation which religion alone could give. The
holy father perhaps was not altogether single-minded
in thus fostering the idea of assuming the
cowl, for he was a true Churchman, considering
that the promotion of the temporal aggrandisement
of the Church was an essential part of the
duty of a Christian, a sentiment then universally
prevalent, and not unusual now. He knew that
Sir Richard was the owner of broad acres, and
that now he had no heir to inherit them, and he
often made delicate and incidental allusions to
the fact, which seemed to produce an impression
on the mind of the knight. At last an opportunity
offered itself of speaking out more openly. With a
profound sigh, Sir Richard one day said, when
the conversation had turned upon his estates and
possessions, "Alas! why should I trouble or
concern myself about these lands and the
improvements that might be made on them? I
shall never more be able to derive pleasure from
the possession of them, and I have no heir to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
bequeath them to. What is the good of riches if
they do not afford happiness? A crust and
water from the wayside brook with happiness is
better than untold wealth accompanied with
sorrow and anguish of heart."</p>

<p>Father Anselm saw his opportunity, and
pertinently asked, "Since you have no heir, why
not make the holy Church of Christ your heir?
By doing so you would garner up for yourself
riches in heaven&mdash;an eternity of inconceivable
happiness compared with which in duration your
present suffering is but as the pang of a
moment."</p>

<p>Sir Richard sat musing for the space of a
quarter of an hour, and then said, "Holy Father,
what you say seems good, fitting, and worthy of
consideration. Give me a week to think it over,
and at the expiration of that period I will
commune with you further on the subject," and
Father Anselm took his departure.</p>

<p>At the week's end, when they met again, Sir
Richard opened the subject by saying, "Venerable
Father, I have since our last meeting given deep
consideration to your counsels, and have come to
the resolution of doing as you advise me. I have
determined on assuming the monkish habit;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
spending the remainder of my life in pious
communion with some holy brotherhood; and on
resigning my possessions into the hands of the
Church of God."</p>

<p>"It is good," replied Father Anselm. "Have
you thought of any specific house on which to
bestow your donation?"</p>

<p>"It occurred to me," continued Sir Richard,
"to become a canon of the Augustinian house
recently founded by my feudal Lord, Robert de
Brus, at Guisborough, and to add my lands to its
further endowment."</p>

<p>"Permit me to counsel you otherwise," said the
Father, "Guisborough, as an Augustinian house,
is not so strict in its discipline as other monastic
houses, and is already very fairly endowed. But
there is another, of the Benedictine order, where
you would have an opportunity of cultivating a
more strictly religious and less secular frame of
mind&mdash;I mean Whitby, a holy spot, once
sanctified by the presence of the blessed St.
Hilda. It was founded by King Oswy in 687,
was laid in ruins by the sacrilegious Danes in
867, and so remained for another couple of
hundred years, when God moved the heart of
Will de Percy to refound it as a Priory. Within<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
the last few years it has again been converted
into an Abbey; but it lacks endowment for the
due maintenance of its superior dignity. Let
me advise you, therefore, to cast in your lot with
these Benedictines, and win the approval of God
by bestowing your wealth in his service, where it
is much needed."</p>

<p>Sir Richard assented to this suggestion,
caused a deed of gift to be drawn, in which he
conveyed his lands to the Abbot and convent of
Whitby, and entered the house as a novice; and
in due time, at the expiration of his novitiate,
was admitted as a monk.</p>

<p>Brother Jerome (to use his monastic appellation)
soon attracted notice by the fervour of his
piety, his asceticism, and a strict and sincere
observance of the conventual rules; as well as by
his humility and obedience to the ordinances of
his superiors. It chanced that after he had been
in the house a few years, the Prior, whose
position was that of sub-Abbot in the house,
sickened and died; and, at a meeting of the
chapter to elect his successor, Brother Jerome
was suggested as the most fitting, by his manifest
piety and abilities, for the office; but he resolutely
declined taking it upon himself, preferring, as he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
said, to be rather a hewer of wood or drawer of
water&mdash;the servant of the brotherhood&mdash;than to
hold any superior office.</p>

<p>In the course of his meditations he was wont
to cast a retrospective glance on his past life, and
to grieve over his career as a soldier and a
shedder of blood; especially did he mourn over
the excesses of barbarous cruelty into which he
had been drawn in emulation of the ferocity of
his fellow-soldiers, when marching under the
banner of the Empress, remembering with tears
of bitter remorse, the burning villages, the
homeless people, the corpse-strewn fields, and the
widows and orphans they left in their rear. The
more he thought of these past phases of his life,
the more intense became his self-reproaches
and the compunction excited by a sense of guilt
and sin. He sought by mortification and
maceration of the flesh to make atonement for
these blood-stained deeds, but despite these self-inflicted
punishments, he was not able to find rest
for his soul. For ever, when prostrate in prayer,
would they rise up before him, and the enemy of
mankind would whisper in his ear, "Thou fool!
what is the good of praying and fasting and
weeping? Thy sins are too heinous for pardon;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
thou hast given up thy possessions to secure a
heritage in heaven, but thy guilt is so damning
that thou wilt assuredly find its gate shut against
thee. Instead of leading a miserable and wretched
life here in the cloister, return to the world and
enjoy life while it lasts, for in either case there is
nothing to hope for in the future."</p>

<p>Jerome took counsel of the Abbot, an old,
wise, and experienced Christian, who at once
detected the cloven hoof in the temptation, and
was successful in convincing the tempted one of
the fact, advising him to go on in the course
he was pursuing, assuring him that there was
mercy for the vilest of sinners if penitent, which
afforded him great consolation.</p>

<p>Nevertheless the remorse-stricken sinner
considered that his misdeeds had been such that
he could scarcely do sufficient in the way of
mortification to obliterate the guilt of the past,
and he determined upon withdrawing himself
entirely from communion with his fellow-creatures,
even from the Holy Brotherhood of
Whitby, and devote the remainder of his life to
meditation and prayer altogether apart from the
world.</p>

<p>Connected with the Abbey there was, in a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
solitary place of the forest which fringed the
banks of the Esk, a chapel where the monks
were wont to retire at certain seasons for the
purpose of devotion, away from the bustle and
distraction inevitable in a large community; and
in close proximity to this chapel, Jerome built for
himself a wooden hut in which to pass his
remaining years as a hermit, secluded from
society, living on wild fruit and roots, quenching
his thirst from the streamlet which trickled past,
and spending his days and nights in prayer,
flagellation, and abstinence.</p>

<p>Resident in the neighbourhood of Whitby
were two landed proprietors&mdash;Ralph de Perci,
Lord of Sneton, and William de Brus, Lord of
Ugglebarnby, who were great lovers of hunting
and other field sports, and near them lived one
Allatson, a gentleman and freeholder. The
three were boon companions, and constantly
meeting in the pursuance of country sports, and
at each other's houses for the purpose of
carousing together. One night when they were
thus assembled together they arranged to go
boar-hunting on the following day, which was the
16th of October, 5th Henry II., in the forest of
Eskdale; and soon after dinner they met, attired<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
in their hunting garbs, with boar-staves in their
hands, and accompanied by a pack of boar-hounds,
yelping and barking, and as eager for the sport
as their masters.</p>

<p>A boar was soon started, which plunged
into the recesses of the forest, followed by
the hounds in full cry, and by the hunters,
shouting to encourage them. Onward they
rushed, through brake and briar, the huge
animal clearing a pathway through the tangled
underwood, which enabled his pursuers to follow
without much impediment. Onward they went
in hot speed, the hounds sometimes overtaking
the boar, and tearing him with their fangs, and
the hunters beating him with their staves, maddening
him with rage, and causing him to turn
upon his pursuers, and rend the dogs with his
fangs, as he would also the hunters, could he have
escaped the environment of the dogs; and then
he would dash onward again, evidently becoming
more and more exhausted from wounds and
bruises and loss of blood, until at length they
came in sight of the chapel and hermitage; from
which point we cannot do better than continue
the narrative in the words of Burton, as given in
his "Monasticon Ebor."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span></p>

<p>"The boar," says he, "being very sore and very
hotly pursued, and dead run, took in at the chapel
door and there died, whereof the hermit shut the
hounds out of the chapel and kept himself within
at his meditations, the hounds standing at bay
without.</p>

<p>"The gentlemen called to the hermit (Brother
Jerome), who opened the door. They found the
boar dead, for which they, in very great fury
(because their hounds were put from their game)
did, most violently and cruelly, run at the hermit
with their boar staves, whereby he died soon
after."</p>

<p>Fearful of the consequences of their crime, they
fled to Scarborough, and took sanctuary in the
church; but the Abbot of Whitby, who was a
friend of the King, was authorised to take them
out, "whereby they came in danger of the law,
and not to be privileged, but likely to have the
severity of the law, which was death."</p>

<p>The hermit, who had been brought to Whitby
Abbey, lay at the point of death when the
prisoners were brought thither; and hearing of
their arrival, he besought the Abbot that they
might be brought into his presence; and when
they made their appearance said to them, "I am<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
sure to die of these wounds you gave me."
"Aye," quoth the Abbot, "and they shall surely
die for the same." "Not so," continued the
dying man, "for I will freely forgive them my
death if they will be contented to be enjoined
this penance for the safeguard of their souls."
"Enjoin what penance you will," replied the
culprits, "so that you save our lives." Then
Brother Jerome explained the nature of the
penance:&mdash;"You and yours shall hold your lands
of the Abbot of Whitby and his successors in this
manner. That upon Ascension Eve, you, or
some of you, shall come to the woods of Strayheads,
which is in Eskdale, the same day at
sunrising, and there shall the abbot's officer blow
his horn, to the intent that you may know how
to find him; and he shall deliver unto you,
William de Brus, ten stakes, eleven strutstowers,
and eleven yethers, to be cut by you, or some of
you, with a knife of one penny price; and you,
Ralph de Perci, shall take twenty and one of
each sort, to be cut in the same manner; and
you, Allatson, shall take nine of each sort to be
cut as aforesaid, and to be taken on your backs
and carried to the town of Whitby, and to be
there before nine of the clock the same day<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
before mentioned. If at the same hour of nine
of the clock it be full sea, your labour or service
shall cease; but if it be not full sea, each of you
shall set your stakes at the brim and so yether
them, on each side of your yethers, and so stake
on each side with your strowers, that they may
stand three tides, without removing by the force
thereof. Each of you shall make and execute the
said service at that very hour, every year, except
it shall be full sea at that hour; but when it shall
so fall out, this service shall cease.... You
shall faithfully do this, in remembrance that you
did most cruelly slay me; and that you may the
better call to God for mercy, repent unfeignedly
for your sins, and do good works. The officer of
Eskdale side shall blow&mdash;'Out on you! out on
you! out on you!' for this heinous crime. If
you, or your successors, shall refuse this service,
so long as it shall not be full sea, at the aforesaid
hour, you, or yours, shall forfeit your lands to
the Abbot of Whitby, or his successors. This I
entreat, and earnestly beg that you may have
lives and goods preserved for this service; and
I request of you to promise, by your parts in
Heaven, that it shall be done by you and your
successors as it is aforesaid requested, and I will<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
confirm it by the faith of an honest man." Then
the hermit said, "My soul longeth for the Lord;
and I do freely forgive these men my death, as
Christ forgave the thief upon the cross," and in
the presence of the Abbot and the rest, he said,
moreover, these words, "In manas tuas, domine,
commendo spiritum, meum, avinculis enim mortis
redemisti me Domine veritatis. Amen." So he
yielded up the ghost the 8th day of December,
<span class="smcap">A.D.</span> 1160, upon whose soul God have mercy.
Amen.</p>

<p>In 1753, the service was rendered by the last
of the Allatsons, the Lords of Sneton and
Ugglebarnby having, it is supposed, bought off
their share of the penance. He held a piece
of land, of £10 a year, at Fylingdales, for which
he brought five stakes, eight yethers, and six
strutstowers, and whilst Mr. Cholmley's bailiff,
on an antique bugle horn, blew "out on you,"
he made a slight edge of them a little way into
the shallow of the river.</p>

<p>Burton, writing in 1757, adds, "This little
farm is now out of the Allatson family, but
the present owner performed the service last
Ascension Eve, <span class="smcap">A.D.</span> 1756."</p>

<p>The horn garth or yether hedge, as the fence<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
was called, was constructed yearly on the east
side of the Esk for the purpose of keeping cattle
from the landing places.</p>

<p>Charlton, in his history of Whitby, discredits
this tradition, saying that there were no such
persons as those mentioned, and no chapel, only
a hermitage in the forest; that the making of
the horn garth is of much older date than that
indicated, and that there is no record in the
annals of the abbey of its ever having been
made by way of penance; concluding that it is
altogether a monkish invention.</p>

</div><p><span class="dropletter">A</span>&nbsp;<span class="smcap">little</span> northward of the road from
Bradford to Leeds, four miles distant
from the former and seven from
the latter, lies the village of Calverley, the seat
of a knightly family of that name for some 600
years. They occupied a stately mansion, which
was converted into workmen's tenements early in
the present century, and the chapel transformed
into a wheelwright's shop.</p>

<p>Near by is a lane, a weird and lonesome road
a couple of centuries ago, overshadowed as it was
by trees, which cast a ghostly gloom over it after
the setting of the sun. It was not much
frequented excepting in broad daylight, and even
then only by the bolder and more stout-hearted
of the village rustics, whilst the majority would
as soon have dared to sleep in the charnel-house
under the church as have passed down it by
night, or even in the gloaming. Instances were
known of strangers having unwittingly gone<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
through it, all of whom, however, came forth
with trembling limbs and scared faces, their hair
erect on their heads, and the perspiration
streaming down from their foreheads. When
questioned as to what they had seen, the reply
was always the same, a cloudlike apparition,
thin, transparent, and unsubstantial, bearing the
semblance of a human figure, with no seeming
clothing, but simply a misty, impalpable shape;
the features frenzied with rage and madness, and
in the right hand the appearance of a bloody
dagger. The apparition, they averred, seemed
to consolidate into form out of a mist which
environed them soon after entering the lane, and
continued to accompany them, but without sound,
sign, or motion, save that of gliding along,
accommodating itself to the pace of the terrified
passenger, which was usually that of a full run,
until the other end of the lane was reached, when
it melted again into a mere shapeless mass of
vapour.</p>

<p>The apparition was that of the disquieted soul
of a certain Walter Calverley, which was denied
the calm repose of death, and condemned to flit
about this lane, as a penance for a great and
unnatural crime of which he had been guilty.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
Various attempts were made to exorcise the
restless spirit, but all were ineffectual until
some very potent spiritual agencies were
employed, which were successful in "laying the
ghost," but only for a time, as they operate only
so long as a certain holly tree, planted by the
hand of the delinquent, continues to flourish,
when that decays the ghost may again be looked
for.</p>

<p>The Calverleys (originally Scott) were a
family of distinction in Yorkshire from the time
of Henry I. to the period of the great Civil War,
intermarrying with some of the best families, and
producing a succession of notable men.</p>

<p>John Scott was steward to Maud, daughter of
Malcolm Canmore, King of Scotland, and niece
of Edgar the Atheling, the last scion of the
Saxon race of English Kings; he accompanied
her to England on the occasion of her alliance
with King Henry I., and married Larderina,
daughter of Alphonsus Gospatrick, Lord of
Calverley and other Yorkshire manors, who was
descended from Gospatrick, Earl of Northumbria,
who so stoutly supported the claims of Edgar the
Atheling to the crown of England in opposition
to that of the usurping conqueror, William the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
Norman. By this marriage, John Scott became
<i>j.u.</i> Lord of Calverley.</p>

<p>William, his grandson, gave the vicarage of
Calverley to the chantry of the Blessed Virgin,
York Cathedral, <i>temp.</i> Henry III.</p>

<p>John, his descendant, in the fourteenth
century, assumed the name of de Calverley in
lieu of Scott.</p>

<p>Sir John, Knight, his son, had issue three sons
and a daughter, Isabel, who became Prioress of
Esholt.</p>

<p>John, his son, was one of the squires to Anne,
Queen of Richard II. He fought in the French
wars, was captured there, and beheaded for some
"horrible crime, the particulars of which are not
known," and dying <i>cæl</i>, was succeeded by his
brother, Walter, whose second son, Sir Walter,
was instrumental in the rebuilding of the church
of Calverley, and caused his arms&mdash;six owls&mdash;to
be carved on the woodwork.</p>

<p>Sir John, Knight, his son, was created a
Knight-Banneret, and slain at Shrewsbury, 1403,
fighting under the banner of Henry IV. against
the Percies. Dying <i>s.p.</i>, his brother Walter
succeeded, whose second son, Thomas, was
ancestor, by his wife, Agnes Scargill, of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
Calverleys of Morley and of county Cumberland.</p>

<p>Sir William, his grandson, was created a
Knight-Banneret for valour in the Scottish wars,
by the Earl of Surrey; his grandson, Sir William
Knight, was Sheriff of Yorkshire, and died 1571;
Thomas, his second son, was ancestor of the
Calverleys of county Durham. Sir Walter, his
son, had issue three sons, of whom Edmund, the
third, was ancestor of the Calverleys of counties
Sussex and Surrey.</p>

<p>William, the eldest son of Sir Walter, whose
portrait was exhibited at York in 1868, married
Catherine, daughter of Sir John Thornholm,
Knight, of Haysthorpe, near Bridlington. This
lady was a devoted Catholic, and suffered
much persecution for adhering to her faith
and giving refuge to proscribed priests, the
estates being sequestered and some manors sold
to pay the fine for recusancy. They had issue
Walter, the subject of this tradition.</p>

<p>Walter Calverley was born in the reign of
Elizabeth, and in his youth witnessed the relentless
persecutions which his family, being adherents of
the old faith, had to endure from the ascendant
Protestantism, which held the reins of government.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
Those of the reformed religion were wont
to style Mary the "Bloody Queen," for the
number of executions and barbarities which, in
the name of religion, stained the annals of her
reign; but it was a notable instance of the pot-and-kettle
style of vituperation, as the burning
and hanging and quartering and pressing to death
of Jesuits and seminary priests, and of lay men
and women who afforded them refuge, went on
as merrily during the reigns of her two following
successors, as did the roasting of heretics at
Smithfield and elsewhere under Bonner and
Gardiner. He was witness, when a boy, of the
barbarous treatment to which his mother was
subjected for worshipping God according to the
dictates of her conscience and for daring to shelter
priests of her persuasion.</p>

<p>Walter was a lad of strong passions and
vehement spirit, and the sight of the sufferings
endured by the friends and co-religionists of his
family drove him almost to madness. He would
stamp his foot, clench his fist, and vow vengeance
upon the perpetrators, and it is highly probable
that he consorted and plotted with Guy Fawkes
and others of the gunpowder conspirators at
Scotton, near Knaresborough, and might have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
had a hand in the great plot itself, which
culminated and collapsed in the same year that
he committed the crime which cost him his life.</p>

<p>He married Philippa, daughter of the Hon.
Henry Brooke, fifth son of George, fourth Baron
Cobham, and sister of John, first Baron of the
second creation, and by her had issue three sons,
the third of whom, Henry, succeeded to the estates,
whose son, Sir Walter, was a great sufferer in
person and estate for his loyalty during the Civil
War, and who was father of Sir Walter, who was
created a baronet by Queen Anne in 1711, the
title becoming extinct in 1777, on the death,
without surviving issue, of his son, Sir Walter
Calverley-Blackett.</p>

<p>For a few years the newly-married couple lived
in tolerable harmony and happiness, such as falls
to the lot of most married people. They looked
forward to giving an heir to the family estates
who should perpetuate the name in lineal descent;
but the months and years passed by, and they
began to experience the truth that "hope
deferred maketh the heart sick," as no heir made
his appearance, which was an especial disappointment
to the Lord of the Calverley domain, and
gave rise to the idea that he had married one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
who was barren, and incapable of giving him an
heir. Brooding over this impediment to his
hopes, he grew moody and discontented; treated
his wife not only with neglect, but upbraided her
with opprobrious epithets, treated her with cold
and cruel disfavour, and in his occasional violent
outbursts of passion would wish her dead, that
he might marry again to a more fruitful wife.
Moreover he gave way to over-indulgence in
deep potations of ale, sack, and "distilled waters,"
which added fire and force to his naturally fierce
temperament, and rendered him almost maniacal
in his acts. He was profuse in his hospitality
to his neighbours, frequently giving dinner
parties to his roystering friends, with whom he
would sit until late in the night, or rather until
early in the morning carousing over their cups.</p>

<p>Amongst the friends who thus visited him was
a certain country squire of the name of Leventhorpe,
a young fellow of handsome figure and
insinuating address, who would drink his bottle
with the veriest toper, and yet would conduct
himself in the company of ladies with the utmost
decorum and most fascinating demeanour, would
converse with them on flowers and birds and
tapestry work, and quote with admirable accentuation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
and feeling passages from the writings
of the popular poets, or recite with pathos and
humour the novelettes of the Italian romancists,
which then were the delight of every lady's
boudoir. He was introduced by Calverley to
his wife, and she being naturally of a lively,
vivacious disposition, and, like ladies of the
present age, a passionate admirer of works of
fiction and imagination, she took great pleasure
in his society, as, indeed, he did in hers, and
he was consequently a constant visitor at
Calverley Hall, whether invited or not, and
whether the lady's husband was at home or not;
but always was he gladly welcome, and in pure
innocence and without any idea of impropriety,
by the lady. On his side, too, he went to the
house as a man might do to that of a sister,
without any sentiment save that of friendship,
or, at the utmost, a feeling of platonic love. Not
so, however, the lady's husband. He began to
feel annoyed and disquieted at witnessing their
growing intimacy, but hitherto saw no reason to
doubt the fidelity of his wife. Some twelve
months after the introduction of Leventhorpe to
the Hall, symptoms became evident of the
probable birth of a child, and Calverley at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
first hailed the prospect with satisfaction,
praying and hoping that it might prove to be
the long-wished-for son and heir. In due course
the child was born, and of the desired sex, and
great were the rejoicings and splendid the
banqueting at the christening. The next year a
second son made his appearance, and then dark
thoughts and suspicions began to flit across
Calverley's mind. He considered it strange that
no child should have been born during the early
years of his marriage, but that immediately after
Leventhorpe's introduction to the house his wife
began to prove fruitful, and had borne two
children, with the prospect of a third. He
brooded over these dark thoughts by night and
day until they ripened into positive jealousy and
the belief that the children were Leventhorpe's,
and not his own.</p>

<p>Influenced by these sentiments, he drank still
more deeply, and was frequently subjected to
<i>delirium tremens</i> and maniacal fits of passion,
which rendered him the terror of all by whom he
was surrounded. He could not openly accuse
Leventhorpe of a breach of the seventh commandment,
of which he believed him guilty, as
he had no basis of fact upon which to ground the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
charge; but he found means to quarrel with him
on some frivolous point, and made use of such
expressions of vituperation as he thought would
impel him to demand satisfaction at the sword's
point; but Leventhorpe was a quiet, peaceable
man, who swallowed the affront, attributing it to
the deranged state of his friend's mind, induced
by too free application to the bottle; and he
simply abstained from visiting the house.</p>

<p>"He is a coward as well as a knave," said
Calverley to himself. "No gentleman would
listen to such language as I have used and
submit to it patiently like a beaten cur, without
resenting it with his sword, and this circumstance
proves his guilt, and the certainty of my
suspicions; but I will be amply revenged on
both him and his paramour and their progeny;"
and he drank and drank day after day, and more
and more deeply, until he at length brought himself
to a state fitting him for a madhouse and
personal restraint. Many a time he sought for
Leventhorpe, with the hope of provoking him
to fight, but was not able to accomplish his
purpose, as circumstances had called Leventhorpe
to London, where he remained some months.</p>

<p>In the meantime the third child was born,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
and as the mother's health was delicate, it
was sent out to nurse at a farm-house some
two or three miles distant, and it was then
that Calverley charged his wife, to her face,
with adultery, adding that he felt positively
assured that the children were Leventhorpe's.
She indignantly repelled the charge, assuring him,
with an appeal to the Virgin Mary as to the
truth of what she was saying, that the children
were his and nobody else's; but he would not
listen to her denials&mdash;called her tears, which were
flowing profusely, the hypocritical tears of a
strumpet, and cursed and swore at her,
threatening a dire vengeance on her and her
seducer, and finally left her in a fit of hysterics in
the hands of her women, who had rushed in on
hearing her screams. He then went downstairs
to his dining room and sat down to dinner, but could
not eat much, each mouthful as he swallowed
it seeming as if it would choke him. "Take
these things away," he exclaimed in a furious
tone to his servants, "and bring me sack, and
plenty of it." The terrified menials saw that he
was in one of his maniacal moods, and knew that
it would be aggravated by drinking, but dared
not disobey him. The sack was placed on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
table, and he dismissed the attendants with a
curse. Flagon after flagon he poured out and
drank in rapid succession, which soon produced its
natural effect. "Ah, demon!" said he, "have you
come again to torment me? Why sit you there,
opposite me, grinning and gesticulating? You
are an ugly devil, sure enough, with your fiery
eyes, your pointed horns, and your barbed tail.
You tell me that it were but just to murder my
wife, Leventhorpe, and their brats, and I don't
know but what the advice is good. Aye, twirl your
tail as a dog does when he is pleased; you think
you have got another recruit for your nether
kingdom, and you are right. I live here a hell
upon earth, and I do not see that I shall be
much the worse off with you below; besides I
shall have the satisfaction of vengeance, and that
will repay me amply for any after-death punishment.
Aye, grin on, but leave me now to finish
this bottle in quietness, for I cannot drink with
comfort whilst you are grimacing and jibing at
me there." He spoke this in a loud tone of
voice, to which the scared servants were listening
at the door, after which he continued to drain
goblet after goblet, giving forth utterances more
and more incoherent, until at length he fell from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
his chair with a heavy thump on the floor.
Hearing this, the servants entered, and found
him, as they had often found him before, in a
state of senseless intoxication, and carried him up
to bed.</p>

<p>Having slept off his debauch, he awoke late the
following morning with a raging thirst, which he
endeavoured to assuage by deep draughts of ale.
Breakfast he could eat none, but continued
drinking until his familiar demon again made his
appearance, and seemed to incite him to the
fulfilment of his vow of revenge. Leventhorpe
was out of his reach, but the other destined
victims were at hand, and what more fitting time
than the present for the execution of his purpose?
He selected a dagger from his store of weapons,
and carefully sharpened it to a fine point; then
gave directions to have his horse saddled and
brought to the door of the hall to await his
pleasure. As he had three or four men-servants,
who might hinder him in his intent, he sent them
on several errands about the estate, and when
they had departed, leaving only the female
domestics in the house, he went, dagger in hand,
into the hall, where he found his eldest son
playing. Seizing him by the hair of his head, he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
stabbed him in three or four places, and, taking
him in his arms, carried him bleeding to his
mother's apartment. "There," said he, throwing
the body down, "is one of the fruits of your illicit
intercourse, and the others must share the same
fate." So saying, he laid hold of his second son,
who was in the room, and stabbed him to the
heart. The mother, shrieking with terror and
agony, rushed forward to save the child, but was
too late, and herself received three or four blows
from the dagger, and fell senseless to the floor,
but more from horror and fright than from her
wounds, which were but slight, thanks to a steel
stomacher which she wore. Imagining that he
had killed her as well as the children, he mounted
his horse and rode towards the village, where his
youngest child was at nurse, with the intention of
killing it also, but on the road he was thrown
from his horse, and before he could re-mount was
secured by his servants, who had gone in pursuit
of him.</p>

<p>He was taken before the nearest magistrate&mdash;Sir
John Bland, of Kippax&mdash;and in the course of
his examination stated that he had meditated
the deed for four years, and that he was fully
convinced that the children were not his. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>
was committed to York Castle and brought to
trial, but refusing to plead, was subjected to
<i>peine forte et dure</i>. He was taken to the
press-yard, stripped to his shirt, and laid on a
board with a stone under his back; his arms were
stretched out and secured by cords; another
board was placed over his body, upon which were
laid heavy weights one by one, he being asked in
the intervals if he still refused. He bore the
agony with firmness and endurance, even when
the great pressure broke his ribs and caused
them to protrude from the sides. As weight
after weight was added, nothing could be extorted
from him save groans caused by the intensity of
the pain, which at length ceased and the weights
were removed, revealing a mere mass of crushed
bloody flesh and mangled bones.</p>

<p>The two children died, and the third lived to
succeed to the estates. The mother also recovered,
and married for her second husband Sir
Thomas Burton, Knight.</p>

</div><p><span class="dropletter">I</span><span class="smcap">n</span> the earlier half of the seventeenth
century, and during the Commonwealth,
there dwelt in a mud-walled
and thatched cottage, in the environs of Wakefield,
a "wise woman," as she was styled, named
Jennet Benton, with her son, George Benton.
He had been a soldier in the Parliamentarian
army, but, since its disbandment, had loafed
about Wakefield without any ostensible occupation,
living, as it appeared, on his mother's
earnings in her profession. As a "wise woman,"
she was resorted to by great numbers of people&mdash;by
persons who had lost property, to gain a
clue to the discovery of the pilferers&mdash;by men to
learn the most propitious times for harvesting,
sheepshearing, etc.&mdash;by matrons to obtain charms
for winning back their dissipated or unfaithful
husbands to domestic life, as it existed the first
few months after marriage&mdash;and by young men
and maidens for consultation with her on matters<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
of love; and, as no advice was given without its
equivalent in the coin of the realm, she made a
very fair living, and was enabled to maintain her
son in idleness, who was wont to spend a great
part of his time in pot houses, with other
quondam troopers, their chief topics of discourse
being disputed points of controversy between the
Independents and Presbyterians, and revilings of
the Popish whore of Babylon and her progeny,
the Church of England. Although not imbued
with much of the spirit of piety, Benton, in his
campaigning career, had imbibed much of the
fanaticism, superstition, and phraseology of the
lower class of the Puritans, such of them as
assumed the hypocritical garb of Puritanism to
curry favour with their superiors, who were, as a
rule, men of sincere piety, and, in so doing,
somewhat overdid the part by altogether out-Puritaning
them in the extravagance of their
outbursts of zeal, and in the almost blasphemous
use of Scriptural expressions. Such was Benton
amongst his companions, and he passed for a
fairly godly man. With his mother, however, he
cast off all this assumption of religion and the
use of Bible phrases, for she was a woman who
despised all religions alike, and sneered equally at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>
the "snivelling cant" of the Puritans, the proud
arrogance of the Bishops of the Church, and the
"absurd drivellings" of the Separatists; but
these ideas she was sufficiently wise to keep to
herself, or confide them to her son alone. She
even went occasionally to church and conventicle,
that she might stand well with her customers,
who were of all sects. She had, besides, a
voluble tongue, and was not deficient in intelligence,
so that she was able to converse with
all, each one according to his doctrinal bias, so as
to leave an impression that she was not opposed
but rather inclined to the particular theological
dogma then under discussion.</p>

<p>There was, however, a vague idea prevalent in
Wakefield that Mother Benton was a witch, had
intercourse with the Devil, and was a dangerous
person to deal with otherwise than on friendly
terms. She was old, wrinkled, and ungainly in
features; unmistakable characteristics of the
sisterhood. She was possessed of wisdom in
occult matters seemingly superhuman, which
could only be derived from a compact with Satan.
She had a huge black cat, presumably an imp,
her familiar, who would bristle up his hair and
spit viciously at the old woman's visitors until<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
restrained by her command. On one occasion,
however, a handsome young man came from her
cottage followed by the cat, which was observed
to purr and rub himself affectionately against his
legs, who, it was assumed, could be none other
than the Father of Evil himself, who had assumed
that guise to pay a friendly visit to his servant
and disciple. She was also sometimes away from
her cottage for a night, and the inquiry arose&mdash;for
what purpose, excepting to attend a Sabbath
of the witches. It is true she had never been
seen passing through the air astride of her broom,
but it was noticed that whenever she was absent
on such occasions her broom, which usually stood
outside her cottage door, disappeared also, and
was found in its place again on her return.</p>

<p>At this time the belief in witchcraft was
universally prevalent, as we find in the narrative
of the witches of Fuystone, in the forest of
Knaresborough, who played such pranks in the
family of Edward Fairfax, the translator of Tasso,
about the same time. Indeed it was considered
as impious then to doubt their existence as it is
now-a-days of their master and instigator, for is
there not a Scriptural precept&mdash;"Thou shalt not
suffer a witch to live?" and was there not a witch<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>
of Endor who summoned the spirit of Samuel?
Besides, had not many decrepit half-witted old
women, when subjected to torture, confessed that
they had entered into compact with the Devil,
bargaining their souls for length of years and the
power of inflicting mischief on their neighbours?
It is quite certain that the evidences of Mother
Benton being one of the sisterhood of Satan
were so palpable that had she not been so useful
in Wakefield in her vocation of a "wise woman"
she would have been subjected to the usual ordeal,
by way of testing whether she were a witch
or not. This ordeal consisted of stripping the
accused, tying her thumbs to her great toes and
throwing her into a pond: if she floated, it was a
proof that she, having rejected the baptismal
water of regeneration, the water rejected her, and
she was hauled out and burnt at the stake as an undoubted
witch, but if she sank and were drowned
she was declared innocent; so that, were she
guilty or innocent of the foul crime, the result was
pretty much the same, excepting in the mode of
terminating her existence.</p>

<p>At this time one Richard Jackson held a farm
called Bunny Hall, under a Mr. Stringer, of
Sharlston, which lay near to Jennet Benton's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
cottage. Over one of Jackson's fields was a
pathway, really for the use of the tenant of
the farm, but which was used on sufferance by
others, Jennet and her son frequently having
occasion to pass along it. Jackson, however, in
consequence of the damage done to his crops by
passengers, disputed the right of the public, and
issued a public notice that after a certain date
it would be closed. The people of Wakefield, in
reply to the notice, asserted that it was an
ancient footpath that had belonged to the public
time out of mind, and that they intended to
continue the use of it in spite of Jackson's
prohibition. Jennet and her son were the ringleaders
of this opposition, and after the closure
of the path, passed over the railings placed across
the entrance, and were going along as they had
been wont to do, when they were met by Daniel
Craven, one of Jackson's servants, who told them
that they could not be allowed to cross the field
as it was private property. An angry altercation
ensued, in the course of which George Benton
took up a piece of flint and threw it with great
force at Craven, "wherewith he cut his overlipp
and broake two teeth out of his chaps,"
and thus having overcome their opponent they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>
went onward and out at the other end. An
action for trespass was then laid against George
Benton by Farmer Jackson, who appears to have
won his cause, as Benton "submitted to it, and
indevors were used to end the difference, which
was composed and satisfaction given unto the
said Craven;" satisfaction of a pecuniary nature,
no doubt.</p>

<p>A few days after the judicial termination of the
case, "Jackson <i>v.</i> Benton," the farmer was riding
home from Wakefield market. He had to pass
Jennet's cottage on his road, and he thought to
accost her in a conciliatory style, as he did not
wish to be at variance with his neighbours,
especially with one who had the reputation of
being "a wise woman," whose services he might
require in cases of pilfering, sheep stealing, and
the like; in cases of sickness amongst his
children, or a murrain amongst his cattle; or in
other cases beyond the ken of ordinary mortals;
hence he considered it politic to remain on good
terms with her, although he had felt it his duty
to maintain the action for trespass.</p>

<p>As he approached the cottage, the old woman
was seated outside her door, watching a cauldron
suspended from cross sticks, in which was simmering<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>
a decoction of herbs, to eventuate in a
love philtre probably for some love-sick maiden.
By her side was seated her black cat, who bridled
up and spat viciously at the farmer as he came
up.</p>

<p>"Ah, mother Benton," said he, reining up,
"busy as usual, I see, preparing something for
the benefit of one of your clients."</p>

<p>"It is no business of yours what I am preparing,"
she replied. "I sent not for you, nor do I
want your conversation or interference in my
concerns. Go your way, or it may be the worse
for you."</p>

<p>"Nay, good dame, be not angry, I came not to
interfere with your concerns; I merely stopped
on my road home to say 'good even' to you, and
to see if I could be of any service to you, for I
desire to cultivate the good-will of my
neighbours."</p>

<p>"And a pretty way you have of doing so by
prosecuting them in law courts for maintaining
the rights of themselves and their ancestors for
generations past."</p>

<p>"That I was compelled to do, good Jennet,
for the maintenance of my own rights. It was a
necessity forced upon me, but I bear no ill-will to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>
either you or your son. And see, as a proof
thereof, I have brought you a new kirtle from
Wakefield," at the same time drawing from his
saddlebags a flaming scarlet garment of that kind,
which he threw into her lap.</p>

<p>"Farmer Jackson," said she, "come not here
with your honied lips and deceitful expressions of
friendship. I want none of your gifts," and
taking up the kirtle, she rent it into a dozen
pieces, and thrust them into the fire under the
cauldron.</p>

<p>"Listen to me one moment," commenced
Jackson, but the old beldame, rising up into a
majestic attitude, interrupted him with, "I will
listen no more to your hypocritical palaver.
You have done me a grievous wrong in citing my
son before your law courts, it is an unpardonable
offence, and soon shall you know what it is to
incur the wrath of Jennet Benton, the wise
woman of Wakefield. Within a twelvemonth
and a day, Farmer Jackson, shall you find at
what cost you set the myrmidons of the law
upon me and my belongings, and from that time
to your life's end shall you rue that day's work.
It is I, the wise woman of Wakefield, who say it,
and see if I am not a true soothsayer, and merit<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>
the appellation I bear. That is all I have got to
say," and she passed into her cottage, whilst the
farmer rode homeward, not without a foreboding
of impending evil.</p>

<p>We have many narratives on record of houses
that have been the scenes of remarkable
disturbances and strange apparitions, of furniture
moved from place to place without apparent
agency, of domestic utensils thrown about by no
perceptible impelling power, and of noises
attributable to no human cause, problems that in
many cases have never been solved, but which
have usually been ascribed to some mischievous
goblin, or to the ghost of some unhappy person
who has come by death unfairly and by foul
means.</p>

<p>Farmer Jackson's house and homestead from
this time, for the period of a year and a day,
became haunted in this fashion, but here there
could be no doubt as to the cause. It was the
spell cast over it by the machinations of the
witch, Jennet Benton, and it was in fact not a
haunted but a bewitched house.</p>

<p>As Jackson rode home he thought of the curse
laid upon him by the witch, but being a strong-minded
man he did not entertain the current<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>
superstition as to the superhuman diabolic power
said to be possessed by such persons, and he felt
little or no apprehension on that score; yet he
inclined so far to the popular belief as to fear that
by some means she might cast incantations over
his cattle and crops, so as to cause the former to
sicken and die, and the latter to wither and come
to naught.</p>

<p>On reaching his home he stabled his horse, and
going indoors he accosted his wife with some
cursory remark, but she made no reply, and he
thought to himself, "She is sullen to-night&mdash;in
one of her tantrums; what's the matter, I
wonder." He then sat down to supper, with his
children about him, and a couple of maid-servants
employed in some domestic duty, when his wife
inquired, "Why are you all so silent; are you all
dumb; have you got anything to tell me about
the doings at the market, husband, goodman?"
"What on earth do you mean?" inquired
Jackson; "I spoke to you when I came in, and
there has been noise enough among the children
since then to waken the Seven Sleepers." Mrs.
Jackson still stood staring, with a vacant
countenance, and said, after a pause, "Why don't
you reply? It seems as if one were in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>
charnel-house of the church, surrounded by the
dead." It then occurred to Jackson that his wife
must have suddenly become stone deaf, and by
means of signs and such writing as the family had
at command, he ascertained that such was the
fact; but he dreamt not that it was the beginning
of the witch's spell.</p>

<p>A night or two after, one of the children was
stricken by an epileptic fit, throwing itself about
with great violence and twisting its body with
strange contortions, with convulsive writhings,
and requiring to be held down by three or four
persons to prevent its doing itself an injury.</p>

<p>One morning the swineherd of the farm came
into the room where Jackson was sitting at
breakfast, and with a scared countenance told him
that a herd of swine that had been shut up in
a barn the previous night "had broake thorrow
two barn dores," and had fled no one knew
whither. A search was immediately instituted,
but it was not until after two or three days that
a portion of the herd was found at a considerable
distance from the farm, the remainder being lost
altogether.</p>

<p>On another occasion Jackson himself, "although
helthfull of body, was suddenly taken without any<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>
probable reason to be given or naturall cause
appearing, being sometimes in such extremity
that he conceived himselfe drawne in pieces at
the hart, backe, and shoulders." During the first
fit he heard the sound of music and dancing, as if
in the room where he lay. He partially recovered
the following day, but at twelve o'clock the next
night he had another fit, and during its continuance
he heard a loud ringing of bells, accompanied
by sounds of singing and dancing. He inquired
of his wife, who appears by this time to have
recovered her sense of hearing, what the bell-ringing
and singing meant; but she replied that
she heard nothing of it, as also did his man.
"He asked them againe and againe if they heard
it not. At last he and his wife and servant
heard it (what?) give three hevie groones. At
that instant doggs did howle and yell at the
windows as though they would heve puld them
in pieces."</p>

<p>Jackson now became fully convinced that he
was enduring all these trials and sufferings from
the curse of the witch Jennet, and he expressed
this opinion to his friends who came to condole
with him. They, with neighbourly feeling,
proposed to put the question to the test by submitting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>
the old woman to the usual ordeal of the
horse pond; but he would not hear of this, not
even yet, with such probable evidence, believing
that Satan could be authorised to endow old
women with such mischievous powers. By the
counsel of his friends, however, he sanctioned the
sending a deputation to Jennet to investigate the
matter. The deputation went to her cottage and
told her their errand, but she only laughed at
them. "It is true," said she, "that I called
down the wrath of Heaven upon him and his
belongings for his cruel persecution of a helpless
widow and her orphan son; and if God has
listened to my supplication, and sent calamity
upon him, it is intended as a warning to him
that, for the future, he may be more merciful to
the poor and unprotected. If he chooses to
blame any one, he must attribute his punishment
to a much higher power than a feeble mortal such
as I am."</p>

<p>During all this time Jackson's house was
rendered almost uninhabitable by noises and
apparitions, so that the servants fled from it
panic-stricken, and others could not be found to
take their places. The commencement of the
disturbances was some six months after the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span>
utterance of the curse. The family were seated
at supper when a tremendous crash was heard in
the next room, as if some heavy metal vessel had
been flung violently on the floor. Supposing it
to be something that had fallen from a shelf or a
hook in the ceiling, they went into the room, but
found nothing to account for the noise. At
other times it would seem as if all the doors of
the house were being slammed to, or the windows
shaken as by a storm of wind, although there
was not the slightest agitation in the atmosphere.
Then would occur shrieks as of persons in
distress, groans as of sufferers in agonies of pain,
and bursts of demoniac laughter, with a flapping
of huge bat-like wings. "Apparitions like
blacke dogges and catts were also scene," which
darted out from under the furniture and usually
passed out up the chimney, it being immaterial
whether or not a fire was blazing in the grate.
Along with all these disturbances in the house
and unaccountable illnesses of the various
members of the household, the horses and cattle
of the farm were subjected to similar inflictions,
much to the detriment of Jackson's material
prosperity. Week after week news came in of
the death of horses, cows, and sheep: and in his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>
deposition at York, Jackson said that "since the
time the said Jennet and George Benton
threatened him he hath lost eighteen horses and
meares, and he conceives he hath had all this loss
by the use of some witchcraft or sorcerie by the
said Jennet and George Benton."</p>

<p>For a twelvemonth and a day these disturbances,
sufferings, and losses continued, rendering
Jackson almost bankrupt, and then they all at
once ceased.</p>

<p>Being fully convinced that these troubles had
been caused by the diabolical incantations of the
witch Jennet, he brought a charge against her
and her son, at York, of practising witchcraft
against him, and they were tried at the assizes
on the 7th June, 1656. The depositions of the
trial are printed in a volume published by the
Surtees Society in 1861, entitled "Depositions
from the Castle of York relating to offences
committed in the northern counties during the
seventeenth century. Edited by J. Raine."</p>

<h3>Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm</h3>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.</p>

<p>Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org.</p>

<h3>Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation</h3>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.</p>

<p>The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/donate">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.</p>

<p>While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.</p>

<p>International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.</p>

<p>Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate</p>

<h3>Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.</h3>

<p>Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.</p>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.</p>

<p>Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org</p>

<p>This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.</p>
